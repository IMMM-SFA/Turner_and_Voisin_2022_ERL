Title = {{Systematic evaluation for hydropower exploitation rationality in

Abstract = {{Despite the considerable contribution of hydropower for meeting
   electricity demand and meanwhile achieving free carbon emission, the
   rationality of hydropower exploitation needs to be reassessed in the
   context of hydropower curtailment being severe in some hydro-dominant
   areas. In this paper, a twostage fuzzy-stochastic chance-constrained
   interval (TFCI) regional energy system optimization model under multiple
   complexities is developed for systematically assessing the rationality
   of existing hydropower exploitation plan, and reflecting the tradeoff
   between system cost and reliability for Sichuan territory where the
   exploitable hydropower resources rank first in China. Results showed
   that the degree of hydropower overcapacity would become far more severe
   under the real existing energy structure planning. Instead of
   continuously boosting hydropower exploitation, proper limitation on
   hydropower installed capacity expansion to make other renewable energy
   obtain deserved promotion can effectively reduce system cost and improve
   the utilization efficiency of all the renewable technologies. The
   highest utilization efficiency of hydropower, wind power and solar power
   could achieve {[}90\%, 100\%], {[}100\%, 100\%], and {[}100\%, 100\%],
   respectively. The obtained results also indicated that greater
   uncertainty about system cost may have to be faced if policymakers aim
   to lower risk and enhance system reliability. Suggestions are provided
   for eliminating the irrationality of hydropower in Sichuan and other
   similar hydro-dominant regions based on above mentioned conclusions. (c)

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{As the largest renewable energy source, hydropower is essential to the
   sustainability of the global energy market. However, a considerable
   amount of water can be lost in the form of evaporation from the
   associated multipurpose reservoirs, and hence enlarge the blue water
   footprint (BWF) of hydropower in a warming climate. To facilitate the
   sustainable management of both water and energy resources under the
   impact of climate change in the contiguous United States (CONUS), the
   BWF values of 143 major multipurpose reservoirs were evaluated during
   the historical period (1985-2014) and two future periods (2020-2049 and
   2070-2099). The historical reservoir evaporation loss was calculated
   using the Landsat-based reservoir surface area and a new evaporation
   rate algorithm that considers the heat storage effect. Future
   projections of runoff availability, hydropower generation, and reservoir
   evaporation were estimated based on the downscaled climate model
   ensemble from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. It
   was found that the BWF for the CONUS is highly spatially heterogeneous,
   with an average value of 26.2 m(3) MWh(-1) in the historical period. In
   the future, the BWF values are projected to increase under both
   Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. This
   is especially noticeable under RCP 8.5, which has an average BWF value
   of 30.2 m(3) MWh(-1) for 2070-2099 (increasing by 15.3\% from 26.2 m(3)
   MWh(-1)). The uncertainty ranges increase even more, from 3.4 m(3)
   MWh(-1) during 2020-2049 to 5.7 m(3) MWh(-1) during 2070-2099. These
   findings can benefit water and energy resources management in
   identifying suitable environmental, economic, operational, and
   investment strategies for multipurpose reservoirs in a changing
   environment.}},

   interlinkage research agenda through a systematic review}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{138}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The resource nexus consists of a framework to address interlinkages
   between natural resources and systems that provide water, energy, food
   and waste management. It transcends traditional assessments conducted in
   ``silos{''}, raising trade-offs and synergies that are rarely
   acknowledged. The nexus framework is intrinsically context specific, as
   each respective region has particularities in terms of critical
   interlinkages. Brazil is the world's eighth largest economy {[}1] and is
   heavily reliant on natural resources. This paper considers Brazil to be
   a textbook case for nexus research that identifies critical
   interlinkages that are neglected by literature, which is typically based
   on single-resource analysis. It proposes a research agenda to advance
   resource nexus assessments and improve resource governance in Brazil. We
   propose a novel method for nexus research, systematically reviewing
   geographical context-specific papers in relevant single nexus dimensions
   and establishing resource interlinkages that characterise research gaps
   and policy priorities. We found that 36\% of practices reviewed involve
   more than one resource at a time, characterising interlinkages not
   analysed by the literature. Lastly, selected quantitative indicators
   were used to identify critical interlinkages by analysing the
   representativeness of practices in the national context, and the
   relevance of synergies or trade-offs for Brazil. Critical interlinkages
   in Brazil were found to be irrigation for energy crop expansion (water,
   food and energy); transport biofuels and fuelwood (water, energy, food);
   deforestation for new pasture (water, energy, food); and hydropower
   generation (water and energy). These are, therefore, priorities for
   future nexus research and for efforts to address synergies and
   trade-offs in resource governance.}},

Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{137}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{With the great successes in improving rural electrification and reducing
   poverty, China's small hydropower (SHP) development is expected to
   provide a good example for other developing countries. However,
   recently, nearly all new SHP development plans have been halted, and
   many plants have been urged to shut down or even be removed. The SHP
   industry in China is now in a dilemma. This paper presents a review of
   the status of SHP development in China and explores the challenges
   troubling this industry. It was revealed that SHP resources in many
   provinces have been intensively exploited, with an exploration rate over
   0.80, while untapped resources are primarily located in remote western
   provinces, such as ecologically fragile Tibet. This intensive and
   disordered SHP development has caused serious dewatering of rivers and
   affected local agricultural and household water access, which arouses
   fierce controversy. Moreover, the role of SHP has been gradually
   weakened by the extension of power grids and diversified electricity
   sources. Therefore, the transition and upgrade of the SHP industry has
   become critical to enhance its sustainable development and to provide a
   solid example for the world. A divergence management strategy for SHP
   should be adopted to achieve low-impact development, as opposed to blind
   large-scale development or rigidly discontinuing all projects. Future
   transition strategies are proposed in this paper that include delicate
   management of existing plants and construction of new plants with higher
   standards, as well as pathways for the development benefits to be shared
   by a wider range of local residents.}},

Abstract = {{Resource and environmental elements as controlling factors for ecologic
   and socio-economic are crucial to seek new ideas and paths for
   development and prosperity. In this study, environmentally-extended
   input-output analysis and ecological network analysis were combined to
   develop three ecological networks including energy ecological network,
   water ecological network, and carbon ecological network for searching
   the complex relationships among different departments for water
   utilization, energy consumption, and carbon emissions under considering
   China as a superorganism with various complex metabolic processes and
   the most fundamental metabolic materials. The embodied ecological

   material flows, the ecological relationships, and the dependence
   intensities among sectors was obtained through transforming the monetary
   input-output data to physical data from 2007, 2012, and 2017. The
   results show that the Energy Ecological Network and Water Ecological
   Network were in a relatively stable state with a mutualism index greater
   than 1, and the relationship among different sectors in the CO2
   Ecological Network needs to be further adjusted. AM (Advanced
   Manufacture) and Agr (Agriculture) played the top exporter and importer
   roles with AM as the largest embodied energy consumer and CO2 emitter,
   and Agr as the largest embodied water user. More measures about resource
   conservation and emission reduction for AM and Agr are desired. Con
   (construction) had a strong dependence intensity on other sectors with
   amounts of over 90\%. Resources and environmental effects on Con can be
   improved by increasing the utilization efficiency of intermediate

   of the substitutability of nuclear energy and hydropower for fossil
   fuels in Canada}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREEN ENERGY}},
Abstract = {{The dominance of fossil fuels in electricity generation fuel mix
   continues to undermine the importance of electricity as a critical
   factor for sustainable economic development. As with most economies of
   the world, the Canadian fuel mix for electricity generation is dominated
   by fossil fuels. This scenario creates both environmental and resource
   sustainability challenges. There are questions marks over the potentials
   of nonfossil energy sources to address these challenges and ensure a
   more sustainable electricity generation. This study aims to examine the
   potentials of nuclear energy and hydropower to substitute the fossil
   fuels of coal and natural gas in electricity generation for Canada. A
   trans-log production function was estimated with the ridge regression
   method to obtain the parameter estimates. The empirical findings show
   that, with the exception of coal input, all energy inputs have positive
   output elasticities, which indicate that an increase in the energy
   inputs will increase output in Canada. The results further provide
   evidence of positive elasticity of substitution between the non-fossil
   energy sources and the fossil fuels which give credence to the
   hypothesis that clean energy sources such as nuclear energy and
   hydropower have the potential to substitute for the fossil fuels of coal
   and natural gas the electricity generation process for Canada. The
   estimates show that the smallest substitution occurs between coal and
   gas, which is an additional evidence that clean energy has higher
   chances of substituting fossil fuels. Policies that promote the adoption
   of more renewable and clean energy sources are recommended in the body
   of the paper.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions of water, energy, and food, which are essential

   The results indicated that the synergistic safety of the WEF system in

Abstract = {{The sustainable development of the water-energy-food (WEF) system has
   gained global attention as a result of limited land resources,
   inadequate energy supply and growing water stress. Coordination degree
   is an important indicator to measure the sustainable development of the
   WEF system. Improving the coordination degree contributes to the
   sustainable development of the WEF system and affects regional economic
   development. The extended Cobb-Douglas function is applied to examine
   the relationship between coordination degree of the WEF system and
   regional economic development in 31 provinces of China during the period
   of 2007-2018. By using the system generalized method of moments (GMM)
   estimation, empirical results indicate that in the regions with low
   coordination degree, improved coordination degree of the WEF system will
   hinder regional economic growth. In the regions with high coordination
   degree, it will promote regional economic growth. The results indicate
   that there is a lag period for the influence of improved coordination
   degree on regional economic growth. When making resources management
   policies, shortening the lag period is conducive to achieving
   sustainable development and promoting regional economic development.
   Governments of various regions should formulate different resource

Abstract = {{Distributed energy resource (DER) including wind power, solar energy and
   energy storage system (ESS) are connected to the active distribution
   network (ADN) in various combination ways, which makes the distribution
   network have interaction. As a bridge connecting the transmission grid
   (TG) and micro grid (MG), ADN breaks the traditional operation pattern
   of TG + ADN + MG. Considering the physical connections and shared
   information among TG, ADN and MG, this paper proposes a decentralized
   and parallel analytical target cascading (ATC) algorithm for interactive
   unit commitment (UC) implementation in regional power systems. To
   explore the synergistic ability of the TG + ADN + MG coping with
   uncertainties of DER, i.e., wind power, the primary and secondary
   frequency regulation of TG are implemented to cope with uncertainties.
   Furthermore, the distributional uncertainty of wind power is well
   modeled by data driven, which is proposed in our previous work (Zhang et
   al., 2019) {[}1]. Both the startup/shutdown variables of the thermal
   units and the variables in TG + ADN + MG are integrated into the
   multi-level interactive UC model to optimize simultaneously, thus
   realizing the optimal goal of the whole network, resources complementary
   and optimal allocation of power system. An improved 6-bus system is used
   to test the proposed model, the numerical results show that the proposed
   decentralized algorithm is a fully parallelized procedure. And it also
   demonstrates the parallel implementation significantly enhances

   energy and water in cities. With Beijing as a case, 26 scenarios are
   designed to explore the energy saving/water saving of different policies
   in Beijing in the future and its nexus effect, including the sensitivity
   analysis of the results. The results show that the total energy
   consumption in Beijing will grow slowly by year. Carbon emissions will
   peak in 2020, and fluctuate after 2035 it will slowly increase until
   2050. Total water demand is stable between 3.6 and 4.1 billion cubic
   meters. According to the forecasted water supply capacity, there is no
   shortage of water supply and demand. The proportion of groundwater from
   the source of water supply fell to 27\%, and the proportion of water in
   the South-to-North Water Transfer increased to 40\%. The total energy
   saving of the ``13th Five-Year Plan{''} water saving policy is 1.003
   million tons of standard coal, which is equivalent to 8.165 billion kWh
   of electricity. The energy saving policy has reached 276 million cubic
   meters of water, equivalent to 140 Kunming Lakes. The energy demand of
   residents' lives, service industry, construction industry and
   traditional manufacturing industry has a good correlation with water
   demand value, which proved they are important water-coupled sectors. In
   terms of energy-saving/water-saving effects in different scenarios and
   recent/long range periods, the industrial structure optimization policy
   showed good energy-saving potential in the short-term, but the long-term
   energy-saving effect was not obvious, while it was accompanied by an
   increase in water consumption. The irrigation technology innovation and
   planting structure optimization scenarios in the agricultural sector
   have better energy saving and water saving effects in the short term.
   However, with the occurrence and further expansion of water shortage,
   the medium and long term the water saving effect is sill, while the
   energy saving effect is not significant. The sensitivity analysis shows
   that the parameters of the scenario such as economic slowdown,
   industrial structure optimization, development of public transportation,
   and planting structure optimization are more sensitive. For the
   synergistic effect of water and energy conservation, the synergy effect
   is more obvious in the energy saving scenarios of the service industry
   and the industrial sector. For the policies of the same department, the
   synergistic saving effect of the situation of improving energy intensity
   is obvious. From the perspective of the difficulty in policy
   implementation process and overview effects, the water saving and energy
   saving policies of the industrial sector face more difficulties while
   implementation. The external power regulation policy and the capital
   rising residents' wareness of water saving policy has good performance
   both in the difficulty of implementation and overview effects.}},

   of Xinanjiang Reservoir in China}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Climate and land use changes will affect the hydrological regime, and
   therefore hydropower. This study which aims to develop a novel modeling
   framework, does not only determine the changes in hydropower generation
   and sustainability, but also provide robust operating rules for handling
   uncertainty attributed to both climate and land use changes, using
   Xinanjiang Reservoir in Eastern China as a case study. Specifically,
   projections of five bias-corrected and downscaled General Circulation
   Models (GCMs) and three modeled land uses representing a range of
   tradeoffs between ecological protection and urban development are
   employed to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and to
   predict streamflow under 15 scenarios. We then develop a set of robust
   rule curves to consider the potential uncertainty in reservoir inflow
   and to increase hydropower generation, and a baseline rule is presented
   for comparison. Results show that both robust and baseline rules
   increase hydropower generation with increasing reservoir inflows in
   future, but the robust rule yields better hydropower generation,
   sustainability and efficiency. The streamflow under the rapid
   urbanization scenarios differs from that under other scenarios, but
   there are no significant differences in hydropower among scenarios
   corresponding to the non-linear relationship between streamflow and
   hydropower change. Our findings highlight the potential to improve water
   resource utilization in the future, especially based on the robust
   operating rule considering optimization and uncertainty, and can provide
   references for future hydropower planning to the other existing plants.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{281}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposed a model-based framework to optimize the
   energy-water-emissions nexus (EWEN) for regional electric power system
   (EPS) planning. The framework integrated the superiority of bi-level
   programming (BLP), two-stage stochastic programming (TSP), mix-integer
   programming (MIP), interval parameter programming (IPP) models and
   carbon emission trading (CET) mechanism, which could effectively deal
   with the planning problems in the EWEN optimization process. BLP helped
   decision makers make leader-follower choices when they have conflicting
   preferences. TSP with IPP could validly address the uncertain
   information expressed as interval values with unknown distribution. MIP
   was introduced as an efficacious tool to evaluate the capacity expansion
   potential in EPS. CET mechanism was applied to reinforce the CO2
   mitigation effect during the EWEN optimization process. Then the
   proposed framework was applied into a case study in Shanxi Province, a
   main thermal power base in China to optimize the EWEN. Results indicated
   that the power supply structure was inclined to show a low-carbon
   transition trend in the planning periods. Meanwhile, coupled with the
   strict water conservation policy, every 5\% reduction in carbon emission
   density would lead to an average decreasing rate of 8\% for SO2, 3\% for
   NOx and 12\% for PM. This study may help provide an effective way to
   deal with planning problems with conflicting and sequential goals under
   uncertainty and make better tradeoff strategies in EWEN optimization in

Title = {{Water quality impacts of small hydroelectric power plants in a tributary
   to the Pantanal floodplain, Brazil}},
Journal = {{RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{Small hydroelectric power (SHP) facilities are proliferating around the
   world, including in Brazil where legislation encourages SHP over other
   hydropower development, defining SHP as facilities with installed
   capacities of 3-30 MW and reservoirs <13 km(2). SHP facilities are often
   diversion designs with small or no reservoirs, while other SHPs have
   more conventional dams that create extensive reservoirs. This study
   seeks to understand the relative impacts of these two different designs
   on downstream water quality, comparing a conventional SHP system on the
   main stem to a complex of smaller SHPs with diversion designs in
   lower-order reaches of the Sao Lourenco River. This river delivers
   nutrients and sediments to the Pantanal, one of the world's largest
   floodplain ecosystems. Samples collected upstream and downstream of each
   set of facilities over a range of flows revealed that the conventional
   SHP reservoir significantly reduced pH, dissolved oxygen, total iron,
   suspended solids, and turbidity consistent with observations in many
   other reservoirs. In contrast, water quality changes downstream of the
   smaller SHPs were less pronounced and could be attributable to natural
   variability. An analysis of energy production versus water quality
   impacts suggests that SHPs on the smaller tributaries are favorable
   compared to the conventional SHP in terms of water quality impacts. With
   the proposed addition of dozens of new facilities in the upland
   watersheds draining into the Pantanal, this study improves our
   understanding of the relative impacts of different designs of SHPs on
   downstream water quality, while recognizing that water quality is just
   one of several potential impacts to be considered.}},

Journal = {{IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION}},
Abstract = {{Owing to random load changes and transmission time delays in
   interconnected power systems with renewable energy, the load frequency
   control scheme has become one of the main methods to keep stability and
   security of power systems. To relieve communication burden and increase
   network utilisation, an adaptive event-triggered scheme is explored.
   Then, a new fractional-order global sliding mode control scheme
   comprising the fractional-order term in the sliding surface is adopted
   to improve robustness of load frequency control. The fractional-order
   term generates a new degree of freedom and more adjustable parameters to
   improve control performance. Furthermore, the Markov theory is applied
   in the modelling process to better describe the uncertainty of
   parameters and external disturbances. The stability and stabilisation
   criteria for multi-area power systems load frequency control are put
   forward by employing the improved Lyapunov function and integral
   inequalities with auxiliary functions. Finally, two simulation examples
   containing a two-area power system and modified IEEE 39-bus New England

Title = {{The land-energy-water nexus of global bioenergy potentials from
   abandoned cropland}},
Journal = {{NATURE SUSTAINABILITY}},
Abstract = {{Bioenergy is a key option in climate change mitigation scenarios.
   Growing perennial grasses on recently abandoned cropland is a near-term
   strategy for gradual bioenergy deployment with reduced risks for food
   security and the environment. However, the extent of global abandoned
   cropland, bioenergy potentials and management requirements are unclear.
   Here we integrate satellite-derived land cover maps with a yield model
   to investigate the land-energy-water nexus of global bioenergy
   potentials. We identified 83 million hectares of abandoned cropland
   between 1992 and 2015, corresponding to 5\% of today's cropland area.
   Bioenergy potentials are 6-39 exajoules per year (11-68\% of today's
   bioenergy demand), depending on multiple local and management factors.
   About 20 exajoules per year can be achieved by increasing today's global
   cropland area and water use by 3\% and 8\%, respectively, and without
   production inside biodiversity hotspots or irrigation in water-scarce
   areas. The consideration of context-specific practices and multiple
   environmental dimensions can mitigate trade-offs of bioenergy
   deployment.
   Bioenergy from grasses is a key option to mitigate climate change. This
   study finds that recently abandoned cropland could help meet 11-68\% of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{As the rapid development of economy, hydropower, as a kind of cleaner
   energy, is bringing in huge economic benefits, leading to the appearance
   of a great many of hydropower plants. Decades after the hydropower
   plants operation, series of quite serious ecological problems were
   brought in due to the changes in the natural flow. To restore the river
   ecosystem, this paper is making efforts on seeking series of operation
   schemes to balance the socio-economic and ecology benefits. Therefore, a
   simulation (Model-I) and an optimization (Model-II) operation model are
   established to provide a feasibility and a reasonable scheme for the
   multi-objective long-term and mid-term hydropower plant operation. To
   resolve the complex model, large-system coordinated decomposition method
   and an idea that efficiently narrows down the search space are used. The
   Irtysh River basin in China is selected as the study area to apply the
   model and make a trade-off to balance the water supply for
   socio-economics and ecology. The results show that the average annual
   power generation of hydropower plant group in Model-I is 2.5\% more than
   that in Model-II, both more than that of practical operation. In Model-I
   the water supply in dry year is far less than the minimum need (50\%),
   but the Model-II provided a reasonable solution that the water supply in
   dry year is close to the median need (80\%). Besides, the water supply
   for ecology in Model-II is obviously increased compared with Model-I,
   and the ratio increases from 56\% to 86\%, at the same time, the ratios
   to socio-economics are from 92\% to 98\%. Specially, the ratio of
   agricultural irrigation increases from 84\% to 94\%. In a word, the
   scheme meets the water requirements for socio-economics and ecology

Journal = {{ENERGY SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING}},
Abstract = {{The cooling water system is an indispensable part in the removal of the
   indoor cooling load in heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC)
   systems. However, the complexity and strong coupling characteristics of
   the controlled objects lead to unsatisfied control effects in most
   practical engineering applications. In this paper, the cooling water
   system is studied as a whole from the perspective of online application.
   Firstly, the mathematical models of the cooling water system are
   introduced and simplified based on the experimental data from the actual
   system. The simplified models have easy obtained inputs and programmable
   structure, which renders higher feasibility and practicality for the
   model-based control method applied in the real system. On this base, an
   easily implemented control method for cooling water system is proposed
   to improve the global efficiency. By comparing with the conventional
   constant temperature difference control strategy and constant speed
   control strategy in the simulation platform, the proposed water flow
   optimization control strategy is superior in both global COP and energy
   saving at the same operating conditions, and 0.37\% and 3.45\% of energy
   consumption can be saved, respectively. The simulation results imply
   that the proposed simplified method is a referable control method for

Abstract = {{In the face of rapid growth in the global demands for water, energy, and
   food, building large dams is expected to continue. Due to its potential
   opportunities and risks for the people of the Eastern Nile Basin, the
   Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Nile River has commanded
   regional and international attention. Once completed, it will rank the
   largest hydropower dam in Africa and among the largest worldwide.
   Discourse among scientists and negotiators from Ethiopia, Sudan, and
   Egypt on the design, initial filling, and long-term operation of the
   GERD is ongoing since the construction started in 2011, but no agreement
   has yet been reached. The discourse has hitherto focused on the impacts
   on hydropower production, water availability, and irrigated agriculture,
   with little attention to the dam's potential environmental impacts.
   Here, we communicate our viewpoint on this gap, drawing on knowledge
   from other dams around the world and some GERD characteristics. The
   hydrological alterations associated with the GERD could adversely impact
   fish, aquatic plants, and biodiversity in the downstream due to possible
   changes in water temperature, salinity, and oxygen content. The GERD's
   expected flooded area, location at low latitude in the tropics, and the
   deep turbine intakes could intensify greenhouse gas emissions, whereas
   the dam's high reservoir depth would abate the emissions. The dam's
   electricity could also reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions if
   combined with cleaner intermittent solar and wind energy sources. With a
   maximum reservoir area of 1904 km(2), surface evaporation and
   consequently local extreme precipitation and humidity could increase.
   The aforementioned impacts could have transboundary ecological,
   agricultural, and health implications and, therefore, should be taken
   into consideration alongside the benefits of the dam.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Rare information on the seafood safety and the coastal water-food-energy

   investigated the distribution of heavy metals in 3 kinds of seafood
   (bivalve molluscs, fish, and crustaceans) collected from coastal areas
   along the 18,000 km coastline of China. Risk assessment and source
   apportionment of heavy metals, and the coastal water-food-energy nexus
   sustainability in terms of heavy metal pollution were also performed.
   The results showed that total concentrations of 8 heavy metals (Cu, Pb,
   Zn, Cd, Cr, Hg, As, and Ni) in seafood varied with sampling sites and
   species by following the order of bivalve molluscs > crustaceans > fish.
   Estimated daily intake (EDI) analysis indicated that it was safe for
   humans to consume seafood in all sampling sites. Non-cancer risks posed
   by heavy metals were acceptable for 99.1\% of adult and 97.7\% of
   children. However, Cr and As in 72\% of fish samples caused high cancer
   risks for children. The farmed fish posed relatively low risk in
   comparison with the wild fish suggested that it might be safer to
   consume farmed fish than wild fish. Source apportionment demonstrated
   that the fossil energy consumption (coal combustion and vehicle
   exhaust), seawater, and metallurgic dust might serve as the possible
   main sources of heavy metals in seafood. Based on the policy scenario
   analysis, the fossil-energy-controlling policy and clean coastal water
   action were beneficial to the seafood safety by reducing target heavy
   metals in seafood. These findings provided comprehensive information on

Abstract = {{The eddy covariance (EC) technique-based observation system allows for
   researchers to determine latent and sensible heat fluxes, which are key
   components of the surface energy balance. The number of water and energy
   flux studies in Asia has increased as the number of flux measurement
   sites and the length of the observation periods have grown. To retrace
   the footprints of the AsiaFlux network and predict future research
   directions, we reviewed the progress in water and energy flux studies in
   Asia from the 1990s to the present day. This included studies on
   continuous evapotranspiration (ET) and surface energy balance
   measurements in various ecosystems, from the tropics to the polar
   regions. We also reviewed comparative experiments between the EC
   technique and other observation techniques including the use of a
   lysimeter or scintillometer, data processing techniques, connections
   between carbon and water fluxes, and multi-site syntheses. This paper
   discusses three remaining challenges that are hindering the derivation
   of scientific knowledge for ET and the surface energy balance, namely:
   the non-closure of the surface energy budget, imperfect compatibility
   between open- and closed-path gas analyzers, and difficulty in
   partitioning ET into evaporation and transpiration. If we leverage the
   advantages of the EC technique (i.e., high sampling rates of >= 10 Hz
   and continuous measurement capabilities), standardized methods for
   correcting and partitioning can be developed in the near future.}},

Title = {{The nexus of water-energy-food in China's tourism industry}},
Journal = {{RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{164}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The tourism industry contributes significantly to the growth of the
   global economy and is considered to be strongly associated with a large
   amounts of water and energy consumption. In this study, the tourism
   water footprint (TWF) and the tourism energy footprint (TEF) of 138
   sectors were investigated to examine the waterenergy-food (W-E-F) nexus
   in the Chinese tourism industry from 2012 to 2017 by developing the
   water- and energy-based environmentally extended input-output analysis
   with the tourism satellite account. This study revealed that the W-E-F
   supply groups consumed total 15,556 million m(3) of water and 4,964
   million tce of energy to support the Chinese tourism industry. The
   largest contributor to the total TWF is the indirect water use from the
   food supply group (65\%), while the largest proportion of total TEF is
   contributed by the direct energy use from 11 tourism direct sectors
   (63\%), most especially the air transport sector. A much larger growth
   of the tourism industry was observed in 2017 compared to that of 2012.
   The structure decomposition analysis revealed that the growth of the
   overall water and energy consumption of China tourism is mainly driven
   by the growth of the total tourism expenditure, i.e. the scale effect.
   It is the same case for the food supply group associated with the
   Chinese tourism industry. In contrast, the contribution of the changes
   to the tourism expenditure composition is relatively low. Furthermore,
   the growth in water and energy consumption can be offset effectively by
   reducing the water and energy use coefficient and adjusting the economic
   production structure of tourism and its associated food supply group. In
   sum, the food supply and air transport sectors play a crucial role in
   the waterenergy-food nexus of the tourism industry. Therefore, in the
   future, focus should be placed on improving the water and energy use
   efficiency of these sectors as well as enhancing their production
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, we investigated the relationship between water, food, and energy
   (W-E-F) in different regions of China to provide suggestions for
   sustainable and stable regional development of these resources. Based on
   the system theory, we constructed three relevant subsystems and analyzed
   the action mechanism between them. Furthermore, we constructed a network
   based on the super-efficiency data envelopment analysis model for a
   W-E-F input-output index system. This model was applied to 30 areas in
   China from the year 2005 to 2015 for measuring W-E-F coupling
   efficiency. We conducted a spatial correlation analysis to measure the
   results. This study demonstrated that the overall regional and
   interprovincial W-E-F coupling efficiency was low, with food subsystem
   as the main reason for low efficiency in the entire system and key
   reason for regional differences. When comparing the three subsystems,
   the efficiency value of the water resources subsystem showed little
   change over time. In 2015, the water resource efficiency in most regions
   reached an effective and effective marginal state. The efficiency of the
   energy subsystem and the food subsystem is on the rise. Overall, the
   food subsystem's efficiency is low, and in 2015, the food efficiency of
   several regions in northwest China was between 0.2-0.4 Spatial
   agglomeration was detected in W-E-F coupling efficiency in various
   regions of China. From a local spatial differentiation perspective, the
   proportion of the low-low (LL) space-related agglomeration pattern and
   high-high (HH) agglomeration was substantial. The LL agglomeration was
   primarily concentrated in the western and central underdeveloped areas,

Journal = {{RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{164}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Socioeconomic and climatic changes and limited water resources pose
   various challenges to water, energy, and food sectors across the globe.
   The inevitable interactions between water, energy, and food systems
   bring about trade-offs but also synergies under different decisions and
   policies. To gain insights into these issues, we developed a
   water-energy-food (WEF) nexus model that incorporates both production
   (supply) and demands sides of WEF systems into a single
   system-of-systems model using the system dynamics (SD) approach. The
   model is applied to Saskatchewan, Canada, and so is named WEF-Sask. The
   model results reveal the various levels of sensitivities of water,
   energy, and food (and feed) sectors to the socioeconomic and climatic
   drivers. The analysis of trade-offs and synergies shows that the
   proposed large irrigation expansion (400\%) boosts food production by
   1.6\% while reducing hydropower production by 2.7\% in Saskatchewan.
   Wind energy expansion strategy (from 5\% to 30\% of total capacity)
   makes synergies that not only contribute to electricity supply but also
   reduce greenhouse gas emissions, industrial water demand, and
   groundwater use by 2.0, 5.7, and 3.8\%, respectively. Biofuel use
   (blending mandate: 10\% ethanol and 5\% biodiesel) in transportation
   cuts GHG emissions by 1.2\% but reduces the potential food export (food
   surplus) by 5.0\%. The WEF-Sask model allows for scenario analysis
   toward integrated resources management, and its generic model structure
   can be expanded to other regions.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The growing demand for water, energy, and food caused by rapid
   population and economy growth, has posed severe challenges worldwide.
   Considering cereal is one of the vital foods and China is the principal
   cereal-producing country, this study selected cereal as the center and
   conducted energy and water footprint analysis of cereal production in
   China. The production of three main cereals (i.e., wheat, maize, and
   rice) and their potential environmental footprint in China in the last
   decade were analyzed, while the spatial variation and key factor in 2017
   are explored. Results showed that the correlation between water
   footprint (i.e., human health and ecosystem quality) and energy
   footprint (i.e., resources) was strong because fertilizer and diesel
   production were the key processes for both footprint results. The
   proportions of the three crops on energy footprint impacts were similar,
   while the water footprint of rice production was significant higher than
   that of maize and wheat production. The most serious environmental
   impacts were congregated in the North China Plain and Northeast Plain.
   By using decomposition analysis, the agricultural economic effect is
   found to be the largest driving factor in promoting the growth of
   environmental burdens during the study period. Effective measures
   including optimization of plantation structure, transformation of
   agricultural economy, and implementation of rational agricultural

Abstract = {{The hydroelectricity consumption of China is increasing, and hydropower
   exerts a crucial influence on sustained economic growth. A new method
   for estimating the hydroelectricity consumption of China is developed

   model based on the nonlinear grey Bernoulli model (NGBM(1,1)), which
   outperforms other grey benchmark models by adjusting the nonlinear

   hydroelectricity consumption from 2010 to 2018, the novel model is built
   to predict its volume in the later one-quarter phase of the 13th Five

Abstract = {{In this paper we analyze the relationship between social inequality and
   climate change policy actions in African countries. We examine whether
   the needs of the poor influence mitigation and adaptation policies in
   the region. The continent is characterized by an interesting dynamic
   between inequality and climate change: it is predicted to
   disproportionately bear the effects of climate change, at the same time
   that it accounts for four out of the top five countries with the
   starkest inequality globally. In our analysis, we construct a
   statistical measure of social inequality for a group of 54 African
   countries and use the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions
   (INDCs) to obtain corresponding data on mitigation and adaptation policy
   actions. We then estimate the intensity of the responsiveness of the
   latter to the former. Using fractional regression and data imputation
   methods, we find a statistically significant negative relationship
   between social inequality and climate change policy actions in Africa.
   Across African countries, mitigation and adaptation actions fall by
   about 23\% for every 1\% rise in social inequality. African countries
   are therefore not responding to climate change threats in ways that
   simultaneously reduce social inequality and adapt to climate change.
   Furthermore, there is some evidence that countries emitting more
   pollutants are less likely to take action to address climate change. Our
   results imply that in order to address differences in the burden of
   climate change in Africa, a re-evaluation of current policy actions is

Abstract = {{Increasing water demand for energy industries has raised concerns for

Abstract = {{Inter-regional electricity transmission inevitably brings about

   an optimal energy system planning in Inner Mongolia, China. This model
   can not only deal with uncertainties embedded in the complex energy
   system described as interval values and random variables but also

   advanced the existing optimization methods by introducing the cost risk
   tradeoff information based on the risk preferences of decision-makers.
   The obtained crisp solutions are more feasible, effective and optimum

   promote the economic growth of the electric power sector by 3.05\%. The
   further power supply pattern is going to transform from fossil fuel to
   renewable energy, by which wind and solar power will occupy around 44\%
   of total power generation capacity in West Inner Mongolia. Raising the
   share of renewable energy will be the most effective approach to adjust
   the power generation scheme; meanwhile, reducing carbon intensity will
   significantly contribute to enlarge green energy capacity, enhance
   low-carbon emission and mitigate air pollution. These findings will help
   decision makers gain insights into a more scientific energy system
   planning under various uncertainties.}},

Title = {{Seafood- energy-water nexus: A study on resource use efficiency and the
   environmental impact of seafood consumption in China}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{277}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Issues regarding resource securities have risen exponentially because
   this global change corresponds to energy and water use intensification.
   Measures to mitigate the effects of the severity of the depletion and
   their environmental impacts require that resources accounting are not
   performed in isolation; a framework widely acknowledged as ``nexus{''}.
   This study focused on the seafood supply chain taken into consideration
   the flow intensity and efficient usage of the resources along the chain.
   The study dealt in details the sub-units in the processing and packaging
   (PP) unit and the distributing and marketing (DM) unit along the chain.
   Moreover, the strength and efficient use of the resource was quantified
   as ``nexus strength and nexus quality{''} to have a unified indicator to
   assess the interdependency and efficient use of resources in the seafood
   system. Result shows that; (1) about 2.92 x 10(8) kWh of energy and 4.23
   x 10(7) m(3) of water was used along the entire chain because of the
   direct consumption of seafood in China. It was further shown that, the
   quantity of seafood decreases along the chain and PP unit accounted for
   the highest usage of both energy (52.29\%) and water (81.74\%). (2)
   Handling and storage (HS) sector had the least nexus strength because it
   uses less energy and water though it received the highest quantity of
   seafood and PP had the highest SEW nexus strength. The PP unit was
   revealed the less efficient (lower nexus quality) unit because it uses
   majority of energy and water consumed in the whole chain hence
   contribute highly to related environmental impact released in the chain.
   Furthermore, sensitivity analysis (transport efficiency scenario,
   seafood use efficiency scenario) was conducted to compare resources
   consumption and efficiency usages in the sector. This information can
   assist with coherent policymaking and management to achieve efficiency
   and sustainability in the seafood sector. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Effective energy infrastructure investment strategy could optimize the
   reallocation of energy resources, promote the coordinated development

   paper, from the perspective of inclusive growth, investigates how the

   growth, based on the evidence of China's power grid during 2000-2014.
   The ``Effective Cost Index{''} (ECI) is formulated to measure the
   development degree of power grid infrastructure (PGI) at first. After
   that, the economic growth convergence model is adopted to analyze the
   impact of PGI on regional economic convergence by the method of system
   GMM. Moreover, different PGI investment scenarios are simulated to
   discuss what the optimal investment distribution is. The results present
   that the ECI can impact the regional economic growth negatively, and the
   PGI investment may generate higher marginal benefits for the less
   developed inland areas than the developed coastal areas. In China, the
   most effective way to narrow regional inequality is to distribute the
   PGI investment to the central hub provinces. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Stability region of hydropower plant with surge tank at HVDC sending
   terminal}},
Journal = {{ENERGY SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to study the stability region of hydropower plants
   (HPPs) at high-voltage direct current (HVDC) sending terminal, to
   theoretically predict the frequency stability of isolated HPPs under
   small disturbances. The overall transfer function of the system is
   derived, and the Hurwitz stability criterion is applied to deduce the
   stability region. The theoretical analysis of the stability region and
   time-domain simulation results of the system show good consistency, and
   this proves the accuracy of the model. The focus of this paper is mainly
   on the influence of the hydraulic-mechanical aspects. Improperly tuned
   governor parameters and unfavourable design of the surge tank could lead
   to the frequency instability of HPPs, which appears as divergent
   oscillations of the frequency of units. A key suggestion of this paper
   is that the control strategy should consider the factors from not only
   the electrical side but also hydraulic-mechanical aspects, for enhancing
   the stability of the HVDC sending terminal. Besides, the influence
   mechanism and parameter tuning of frequency limitation controller (FLC)
   are investigated and the results demonstrate its capability of quick
   compensation for power disturbances at the HVDC receiving terminal.}},

Abstract = {{Further reservoir-based hydropower development can contribute to the
   United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) on affordable and

   operation can lead to biodiversity impacts, thus interfering with the

   impact assessment models, to assess potential biodiversity impacts of
   possible future hydropower reservoirs, resulting from land occupation,
   water consumption and methane emissions. We show that careful selection
   of hydropower reservoirs has a large potential to limit biodiversity
   impacts, as for example, 0.3\% of the global hydropower potential
   accounts for 25\% of the terrestrial biodiversity impact. Local
   variations, e.g. species richness, are the dominant explanatory factors
   of the variance in the quantified biodiversity impact and not the mere
   amount of water consumed, or land occupied per kWh. The biodiversity
   impacts are mainly caused by land occupation and water consumption, with
   methane emissions being much less important. Further, we indicate a
   trade-off risk between terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity impacts, as
   due to the weak correlation between terrestrial and aquatic impacts,
   reservoirs with small aquatic biodiversity impacts tend to have larger

Title = {{Further Development of Small Hydropower Facilities May Alter Nutrient
   Transport to the Pantanal Wetland of Brazil}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Small hydropower (SHP) facilities, defined variably but usually by
   installed capacities of <10-50 MW, are proliferating around the world,
   particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Compared to larger
   dams, SHPs are generally viewed as having less environmental impact,
   although there has been little research to support that assertion.
   Numerous SHPs have been built, and many more are in development or
   proposed, in rivers that drain into the Pantanal, a world-renowned
   floodplain wetland system located mostly in Brazil. The upland
   tributaries are important sources of nutrients to the Pantanal,
   affecting the biological productivity of downstream floodplains. This
   study presents measurements from upstream and downstream of 25 current
   hydropower facilities, most of which are SHPs, throughout the upland
   watersheds of the Upper Paraguay River basin to reveal how these
   facilities may affect the concentrations and transport of nutrients in
   rivers flowing to the Pantanal. Artificial neural network models
   estimated the impact of building 80 future SHPs on nutrient transport
   into the Pantanal, based on observations at current facilities as well
   as the spatial distribution of future facilities. Overall impacts of
   current hydropower facilities were not large, and in most cases were
   indistinguishable based on comparisons between upstream and downstream.
   The short water residence times of reservoirs associated with SHPs
   likely explain their tendency to have little or no effect on nutrient
   transport. However, model predictions for hydropower facilities that may
   be built in the future, many on rivers with higher discharge and
   sediment loads, point to significant reductions in overall TN (8\%) and
   TP (29\%) transport, with potential negative consequences for river and
   floodplain productivity. Negative impacts may be either because the
   rivers carry low nutrient concentrations and are thereby sensitive to
   oligotrophication, or they are particularly important overall nutrient
   sources supporting ecosystem productivity in downstream rivers and
   floodplains. Together with a parallel study of sediment transport, these
   results support recommendations that several river systems presently
   lacking dams in their lower reaches should be excluded from future
   hydropower development to maintain the nutrient and sediment supply to
   the Pantanal.}},

Abstract = {{The waste management as the interface between human daily life and
   environment is an important part in rural region. However, the
   micro-scale process analysis from the perspective of an integrated rural

   study, a material and energy flow analysis based on processes is
   presented in a micro-scale to make systematical comparison between

   management. The results indicated that waste management notably affects
   the nitrogen and phosphorus flow in rural areas. Moreover, the
   resource-oriented system can obviously optimize the local
   water-food-energy nexus in terms of energy recovery and nutrient
   consumption. Based on the quantity analysis, chemical fertilizer is also
   found inevitable to guarantee the food supply because of the element

Abstract = {{The deployment of renewable electricity and electric vehicles (EVs)
   provides a synergistic opportunity to accelerate both the
   decarbonization of the power system and the transportation sectors. This
   study investigates the consequences of integrating electric vehicles
   (EVs) in the Chongqing thermal-hydro-wind power system by using the unit

   charging and unmanaged charging) impact the power system, in terms of
   operating costs, CO2 emissions, and curtailment of renewables of the
   power system. We choose the year 2030 as a study year, and the future
   electricity demand, installed capacity, and EVs population in Chongqing
   are projected in this study. Monte Carlo simulations are applied to
   model EV's charging behaviors based on the statistics of private
   vehicles. The results show that EVs could reduce CO2 emissions from the
   power system if coupled with active integration strategies, whereas a
   passive integration strategy is likely to increase CO2 emissions.
   Furthermore, CO2 emissions of EVs when running the power system can be
   74.2 \% lower than the emissions from gasoline-driven vehicles (220
   g/km). Economically, the results show that a smart charging strategy

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Study region: The impounded Wujiang River, Southwest China.
   Study focus: Thermal stratification is an important factor shaping
   aquatic ecosystems in karst hydropower reservoirs. However, the
   underlying mechanism of thermal stratification formation is still
   unclear. Therefore, water temperature and related environmental factors
   were investigated to understand how reservoir hydraulic load (i.e., the
   ratio of the mean water depth to water retention time) affects thermal
   stratification in eight karst hydropower reservoirs on the Wujiang
   River.
   New hydrological insights for the region: The reservoir surface water
   had a higher temperature than the inflowing and released waters. The
   variation in the reservoir thermal stratification showed an obvious
   seasonal pattern, but the extents of the thermal stratification were
   different among the reservoirs. The rate of water temperature change is
   proposed to characterize reservoir thermal stratification and is
   significantly negatively correlated with reservoir hydraulic load,
   suggesting the control of both water depth and retention time on thermal
   stratification. This empirical relationship will be helpful in
   quantitatively evaluating the hydrological effect on thermal
   stratification, which further affects basic environmental parameters
   (including pH, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a) in narrow and deep

Abstract = {{Relative contributions from environmental factors to daily actual
   evapotranspiration (ETa) across a variety of climate zones is a widely
   open research question, especially regarding the roles played by soil
   water content ((SWC); water supply) and net radiation ((Rn); energy
   supply) in controlling ETa. Here, the boosted regression tree method
   scheme was employed to quantify environmental controls on daily ETa
   using the global FLUXNET dataset. Similar to the general trend suggested
   by the Budyko theory at annual scales, the results showed that the
   relative control of SWC on daily ETa increased with increasing aridity
   index (phi); however, Rn played a major role at most FLUXNET sites
   (roughly phi < 4), indicating that Rn could be a leading control on
   daily ETa even at water-limited sites. The variability in the relative
   controls of SWC and Rn also partly depended on factors affecting water
   availability for daily ETa (e.g. vegetation characteristics and
   groundwater depth). Our study showed that other than SWC and Rn, the net
   effect of environmental controls (particularly leaf area index) on daily
   ETa was more important at drier sites than at relatively humid sites.
   This suggests that near-surface hydrological processes are more
   sensitive to vegetation variations due to their ability to extract deep
   soil water and enhance ETa, especially under arid and semi-arid climatic
   conditions. Our findings illustrate how environmental controls on daily
   ETa change as the climate dries, which has important implications for
   many scientific disciplines including hydrological, climatic, and
   agricultural studies.}},

Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{22-34}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The last decade has witnessed rapid progress in energy cooperation
   between the countries of the BBIN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal)
   sub-region. Cooperation has been bilateral, with each of the countries
   entering into separate energy development and trade agreement with
   India, broadly similar to the water sector where national governments
   engage bilaterally on transboundary cooperation and dispute resolution.
   A more recent wave of electrical grid interconnections and hydro-energy
   cooperation has emerged with governments increasingly shifting from
   bilateral to multilateral energy-sharing agreements. This trend holds
   considerable potential for regional transboundary water governance.
   Based on documentary and media analysis along with interviews of key
   BBIN policy-makers, we identify and examine in this paper four factors
   for future progress: 1) technical cooperation can be extended to
   information-sharing for policies and institutions to regulate and manage
   water resources; 2) India must seize the opportunities and benefits of
   enhanced regional leadership in the region; 3) simultaneous informal
   discussion and diplomatic negotiation of water, energy and their nexus
   can provide BBIN countries the opportunity to highlight potential gains
   of cooperation and interstate inter-dependencies; and 4) regional
   cooperation can give a strong impetus to nations for advancing
   structural reforms, building institutions and capacity, developing a
   shared knowledge base, bridging infrastructural gaps, attracting private
   sector participation, and addressing poverty alleviation goals including
   job creation.}},

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{596-612}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Brazil depends on hydroelectricity. Recently, concerns related to the
   water consumption by the hydro-power plants (HPs) are increasing, mainly
   because of the severe droughts that have affected Parana Hydrograph
   Region (PHR). PHR accounts for more than 60\% of the hydroelectricity
   produced in the country, being one of the most important in the world.
   This study aimed to evaluate Gross and NetWater Footprints (GWF and NWF)
   in 67 HPs installed in PHR that are belong to the Brazilian
   interconnected power generation and transmission system (SIN), focusing
   on a regional analyzes approach. We could observe that HPs with
   reservoirs for streamflow regularization presented the highest values of
   WF. HPs with a lake at a constant level (run-of-river scheme) showed the
   lowest WF values. A significant relationship between GWF and NWF and
   flooded area/installed power ratio (A/P) could be assessed by analyzing
   the HPs individually as well as in the basins. On average, NWF
   corresponded to 44.6\% of the GWF, being below the average that has been
   estimated around the world. GWF and NWF of the hydroelectricity in PHR
   between 2002 and 2016 were, respectively, 25 and 11 m(3) GJ(-1), both
   lower than values estimated for other plants and regions in the world.

Title = {{Assessing concurrent effects of climate change on hydropower supply,
   electricity demand, and greenhouse gas emissions in the Upper Yangtze
   River Basin of China}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{279}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Hydropower importantly provides flexible low-carbon electricity,
   however, climate change will affect the hydropower system through
   altering hydrologic regimes while also affecting electricity demands for
   heating and cooling that hydropower resources serve. This study assesses
   the effect of climate change on hydropower and electricity demand in the
   Upper Yangtze River Basin (UYRB) in China on the regional net electric
   load and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is accomplished by using
   climate projections from five global climate models (GCMs) to
   simultaneously force (1) a physically-based hydrological model and a
   statistically-based hydropower model to estimate the future generating
   capacity of 21 large hydropower plants in the UYRB and (2) an empirical
   electricity demand model accounting for socioeconomic and climatic
   factors. Under climate change, the projected hydropower generation in
   the UYRB tends to increase in the 21st century but is far less than the
   increase in electricity demand, increasing the gap between demand and
   supply. Future increases in overall electricity demand are driven by GDP
   growth, but climate change will alter the distribution of the seasonal
   electricity demand. Climate warming decreases electricity demand for
   heating in winter and increases electricity demand for cooling in
   summer, but ultimately increases demand. Meanwhile, there is an
   increasing mismatch between electricity demand and hydropower supply
   associated with interand intra-annual variations, owing to the temporal
   climate change and increase in compound climate extremes (droughts and
   heatwaves). Finally, meeting the gap between supply and demand due to
   climate change is estimated to contribute 79.0-184.6 and 50.6-316.2 MMT
   CO2e/yr of additional GHG emissions by the mid and end of 21st century,

Abstract = {{Energy and water are interdependent and interwoven, forming energy-water
   nexus. The chronic of water shortage in China can make a negative impact
   on energy system and further hinder the socioeconomic sustainable
   development. The coal-dominated energy structure consumes a large amount
   of water, which further intensities the dilemma between increasing
   energy demand and shrinking water resources. In this study, a China's
   non-deterministic energy-water nexus (CNEWN) model is established
   through incorporating techniques of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and
   interval-parameter programming (IPP). The CNEWN model is capable of
   simulating probability distributions of water availability, reflecting
   uncertainties derived from economic development and technology choice,
   and providing optimal scheme for China's energy system management over a
   long-term (2021-2050) horizon. Multiple scenarios are set up to quantify
   the impact of water availability on the national-scale energy system and
   sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the influence of uncertain
   parameters on modeling outputs. Results indicate that a variety of
   uncertainties existed in the energy system's parameters can affect the
   modeling outputs and the making decisions. Strict water availability
   constraints can stimulate the development of renewable energies and
   promote the transition of energy structure to clean and low-carbon
   pattern. Results also reveal that water scarcity can have a significant
   influence on the national energy system assocaited with water resources
   utilization, pollutant and carbon dioxide emissions, as well as system
   cost. The results provide a solid scientific basis for coordinately
   optimizing energy and water as well as effectively supporting the

Abstract = {{Concern toward air and water pollution is increasing worldwide due to

   city-level carbon dioxide calculations at the inventory level and failed

   and water pollution at the city level were quantitatively analyzed from
   environmental and economic perspectives by conducting a case study of

   demonstrated that energy consumption contributed the most to the overall
   impacts. CO2, PM10, SO2, and Cu are key crucial substances for reducing
   environmental and economic burdens. Key sector analysis revealed that
   the impacts were mainly due to raw coal consumption in the electric and

   1.45 times higher than that of direct emissions. Effective measures of

Journal = {{RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{We developed the habitat suitability criteria for the black-necked Crane
   (BNC) to manage their wintering habitat in the Nyamjang Chu River in
   Zemithang valley, India. We generated habitat suitability criteria (HSC)
   curves for BNC based on the habitat availability in the river channel
   and use by the BNC. The HSC curves indicated that BNC preferred velocity
   ranged from 0 to 0.2 m/s and depth ranged from 0 to 30 cm in the river
   channel. Based on the HSCs of BNC, three scenarios were explored in
   PHABSIM: Scenario (i) increase in flow versus dry riverbed area;
   Scenario (ii) increase in flow versus instream suitable area; Scenario
   (iii) increase in flow versus weighted usable area based on combined dry
   and instream suitable area. The output of Scenario (i) indicated at 20
   cumecs discharge achieved optimum dry riverbed area (47.07\%) available
   for BNC, whereas Scenario (ii) predicted the different section of the
   river produced optimum instream area at different discharges. Though,
   the Scenario (iii) predicted at 20 cumecs discharge, the study area
   generated more than 57.38\% of combined suitable habitat available for
   BNC. Since a proposed hydropower dam in the Zemithang valley is intend
   to raise water level in the river channel, it is expected to be reduced
   suitable habitat for BNC in the valley. Based on the PHABSIM output, we
   concluded that the availability of suitable habitat of BNC decreases
   steadily if the discharge flow increases above 20 cumecs. Moreover, the
   predicted average dry riverbed area (47.07\%) at 20 cumecs was almost
   equal to the percentage of dry riverbed area (47.8\%) that was naturally
   available during the winter. Thus, we recommend a maximum of 20 cumecs
   as ecological flows to maintain the minimum required habitats for
   wintering BNC in the Nyamjang Chu River. Consequently, the installation
   of the proposed dam in Zemithang valley may not be feasible.}},

Title = {{Further Development of Small Hydropower Facilities Will Significantly
   Reduce Sediment Transport to the Pantanal Wetland of Brazil}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Small hydropower (SHP) facilities, which are defined by installed
   capacities <10-50 MW, are increasingly being built around the world.
   SHPs are viewed as less environmentally harmful than larger dams,
   although there has been little research to support that assertion.
   Numerous SHPs have been built, and many more are in development or
   proposed, in rivers that drain into the Pantanal, a world-renowned
   floodplain wetland. Three river systems with the largest contributions
   of sediments to the Pantanal-the Cuiaba, upper Taquari, and Coxim
   rivers-remain largely undammed. The upland tributaries transport
   sediments into the Pantanal, thereby affecting geomorphological dynamics
   and biological productivity of downstream floodplains. This study
   presents measurements from upstream and downstream of current hydropower
   facilities, most of which are SHPs, throughout the upland watersheds of
   the Upper Paraguay River basin to reveal how these facilities may affect
   the transport of suspended sediments and of bedload sediments. In
   addition, a predictive model using artificial neural networks (ANNs)
   estimates the impact of building 80 future SHPs on sediment transport
   based on observations at current facilities as well as the spatial
   distribution of future facilities. More than half of current facilities
   retained suspended sediments: 14 of the 29 facilities showed >20\% net
   retention of suspended sediments, two others retained between 10 and
   20\%, seven were within 10\%, and six showed >10\% net release. Bedload
   sediment transport was a small component of total sediment transport in
   rivers with high total sediment loads. Multiyear series of satellite
   images confirm sediment accumulation in several cases. Model predictions
   of the impacts of future hydropower facilities on suspended sediment
   concentrations and transport show retention of a large fraction (often
   much >20\%) of sediment inputs. Summing riverine transport rates for
   inflows into the Pantanal indicates that currently envisioned future
   hydropower development would reduce the suspended sediment transport by
   similar to 62\% from the current rate. This study shows that if SHPs are
   built on sediment-rich rivers, this may prove problematic for the
   facilities as well as for downstream ecosystems. These results support
   recommendations that several river systems presently lacking dams in
   their lower reaches should be excluded from future hydropower
   development to maintain the sediment supply to the Pantanal.}},

Abstract = {{Sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is an emerging meta-heuristic method for the
   complicated global optimization problems, but still suffers from the
   premature convergence problem due to the loss of swarm diversity. To
   improve the SCA performance, this paper develops a modified sine cosine
   algorithm coupled with three improvement strategies, where the
   quasi-opposition learning strategy is used to balance global exploration
   and local exploitation; the random weighting agent produced by multiple
   leader solutions is integrated into the agent's evolution equation to
   improve the convergence rate; the adaptive mutation strategy is designed
   to increase the swarm diversity. The proposed method is compared with
   several famous evolutionary methods on 12 classical test functions, 24
   CEC2005 composite functions and 30 CEC2017 benchmark functions. The
   results show that the proposed method outperforms several control
   methods in both solution quality and convergence rate. Then, the
   long-term operation optimization of multiple hydropower reservoirs in
   China is chosen to testify the engineering practicality of the developed
   method. The simulation results indicate that in different scenarios, the

Abstract = {{Floating photovoltaic systems could be used to mitigate water supply

   Moreover, an economic feasibility analysis is carried out regarding
   energy and water supply. A net present value approach was used to
   conduct this analysis. The software System Advisor Model was employed to
   simulate and compare the performance of two photovoltaic systems in the
   region: floating and ground-mounted. Three scenarios of the surface
   cover are considered for the weirs: 1) the average area occupied by dead
   storage of all weirs; 2) 50\% of the total area of weirs; 3) 70\% of the
   total area of weirs. Results show that the installation of floating

   region: An experimental case study for Yakutia}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{210}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a mathematical model for the collection and
   efficient use of solar energy in hot water systems at permafrost
   regions. A case study was presented for northern territories of the
   Russian Federation in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). Daily maximum
   diffuse solar radiation on a horizontal and inclined surface was
   predicted during the year taking into account cloud coverage. The cloud
   coverage data was taken from the results of five-year monitoring on the
   heliometric station of the Yakutsk city. The modelling of the hourly,
   daily, monthly, and annual amount of solar radiation was performed. The
   mathematical model was turned and finally proved by experimental data
   obtained from the testing rig. The modelling of the domestic hot water
   supply system of particular northern territories was performed using
   solar energy and energy storage. Both models were integrated and
   verified by experimental data accounting a seasonal fluctuation. The
   estimation of the solar energy potential for practical application in
   Yakutia was executed. The operating features of permafrost regions were
   analysed by the developed experimental unit. The application of solenoid
   valve reduces the heat losses during the night by 57\% in June and by
   69\% in November. The case study provides the results of modelling and
   efficient use of solar energy for different daily water flow rates
   during January and June. The results of the case study show the
   possibility to use of solar energy in a hybrid energy system at
   permafrost regions, decarbonize the energy input and contribute regional
   sustainability of northern territories. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{With the exception of Albania, the countries of South-Eastern Europe
   (SEE) have high shares of electricity generation from an ageing fleet of
   coal-fired power units with quite low efficiencies. Energy
   planning-related decision-making regarding whether to modernize or
   replace a significant share of this old generating capacity has to be
   fixed within a global clean energy transition context. At the same time,
   the SEE region has a huge potential for renewable energy deployment and
   energy efficiency implementation. This work presents a generic mixed
   integer linear programming model to determine the optimal energy
   scheduling of a multi-zonal power system following the roadmaps of its
   energy transition process. Through a detailed unit commitment model
   implementing a co-optimization of energy and reserves market with a cost
   minimization objective function, the developed approach determines the
   optimal annual energy mixes of the Romanian power system through the day
   by day iterative solution of all the dates of three specific time
   milestones (2020, 2030, and 2040), where the outputs of a specific date
   comprise the inputs of the next one. The model outputs highlight the
   impacts on the power system in terms of technical, economic, and
   environmental performance. The energy transition towards a renewables
   dominant capacity and production mix guarantees the system's security of
   supply, and improves noticeably its environmental performance, reporting
   a significant decrease in the amount of resulting CO2 emissions. With
   regard to the economic impacts, the wholesale price follows an
   increasing trend due to the parallel increase of the CO2 emission
   pricing, on the grounds that natural gas-fired units and electricity
   interconnections set the system's price during most of the hours of all
   dates and years. The developed optimization framework enables the
   provision of useful insights on the determination of the optimal energy
   roadmaps, by highlighting the influences and the challenges of each

Title = {{The transborder flux of phosphorus in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin:
   Magnitude, patterns and impacts from the cascade hydropower dams in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{590}},

Abstract = {{Nutrients are critical to the development of plant and animal life in
   the river ecological system. In recent years, more attentions have
   arisen on the impact of building hydropower dams to transborder nutrient
   flux in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin (LMRB). In this paper, phosphorus
   was taken as an example, which is considered as one of the most
   significant factors to limit biological activities in the river. The
   Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to access the multisource
   loading pattern of Total Phosphorus (TP) under no-dam scenario, and
   various types of dam construction scenarios analyses were performed to
   investigate potential changes in the transborder TP flux from Lancang
   River Basin (LRB, Chinese part of LMRB) to lower LMRB (other parts of
   LMRB). The results showed that the Total Phosphorus load in the LRB is
   about 27,079 tons/year, of which 85\% TP is collected from July to
   October. The annual TP export at the outlet of the LRB is 14,112
   tons/year under nodam scenario, which accounts for about 4.2\% of the
   total TP loads in the lower LMRB. With seven to twenty-one dams included
   in experiments, TP flux at the outlet of the LRB decreased 50-59\%,
   while the delivered ratio for the lower LMRB decreased 2.1-2.5\%. As a
   summary, building dams has a significant impact on the TP transport
   pattern in the Chinese part of LMRB, but very limited effect in lower
   LMRB according to the modeling results, especially for the Mekong delta.
   Moreover, the existing dams (seven dams) seem to intercept much more
   phosphorus than those dams that are under construction.}},

Title = {{An integrated assessment of the global virtual water trade network of

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The global trade of energy allows for the distribution of the world's
   collective energy resources and, therefore, an increase in energy
   access. However, this network of trade also generates a network of
   virtually traded resources that have been used to produce energy
   commodities. An integrated database of energy trade water footprints is
   necessary to capture interrelated energy and water concerns of a
   globalized economy,and is also motivated by current climate and
   population trends. Here, we quantify and present the virtual water
   embedded in energy trade across the globe from 2012 to 2018, building on
   previous water footprinting and energy virtual water trade studies to
   create an integrated database. We use data from the United Nations
   Comtrade database and combine several literature estimates of water
   consumption of energy commodities to generate the global virtual water
   trade network. Results include a comprehensive database of virtual water
   trade for energy at the country level, greatly expanding the literature
   availability on virtual water trade. The total volume of virtual water
   trade increased 35\% from 157 km(3) in 2012 to 211 km(3) in 2018. The
   global trade of oil and fuelwood are consistent drivers of virtual water
   trade over time, whereas coal, hydrocarbons, and charcoal collectively
   contribute less than 4\% of total virtual water trade between 2012 and
   2018. Electricity, despite a less dense trade network constrained by
   infrastructure, contributes notably to virtual water trade, driven
   largely by water use for hydroelectricity. This study develops an
   integrated assessment of previous virtual water studies to estimate
   global virtual water trade of energy, creating a platform for future
   global studies.}},

Abstract = {{The availability, accessibility, and sustainability of resources can
   enhance or jeopardize the security of meeting human needs for water,
   energy, and food in several regions of the world. For this reason, it is
   crucial to propose strategies that allow quantifying the current
   situation of resource security and preventing alarming scenarios in the
   future. The objective of this paper is to assess the current condition
   of food, energy, and water security of a region with rampant economic
   development, but struggling with natural resources as a result of its
   adverse climatic conditions. An approach for assessing the
   water-energy-food security in arid or semiarid areas is presented
   through different scenarios considering the availability, accessibility,
   and sustainability of the involved resources. The proposed approach is
   applied in the State of Nuevo Leon in Mexico, which is the second-most
   important state regarding contribution to the national Gross Domestic
   Product. Nevertheless, the rapid increase in its population and the
   semiarid climate condition with precedents of natural catastrophes
   jeopardize the continuity of its development. Results show that the
   state may not be able to meet the demands of water and food due to the
   stress generated on its resources. In contrast, the energy situation is
   more promising with the implementation of energy from renewable sources.
   The analysis is carried out over a past time period and making
   projections until 2030, providing a tool to be able to make decisions in
   the medium and long term. The main goal is to propose preventive
   measures and to ensure sustainable planning covering economic, social,
   and environmental needs without compromising the well-being of future
   generations. In this sense, the implementation of new policies for the
   water sector is analyzed, with the aim of reducing domestic and
   agricultural consumption, targeting improvements in the evaluated
   indices.

Title = {{Contribution of offshore wind to the power grid: US air quality
   implications}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{276}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Offshore wind is an established technology in Europe and Asia, but it
   has not yet gained market share in the United States. There is, however,
   increasing interest in offshore wind development in many coastal regions
   of the United States. As offshore wind grows in those regions it will
   displace existing and future electric generation assets, which will lead
   to changes in the emissions from the electric power sector. This
   research explores combinations of two electric sector drivers, offshore
   wind capital costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) caps, to measure the changes
   in the energy mix and quantify offshore wind's impact on electric sector
   emissions. An energy system modeling approach is applied, using a nested
   parametric sensitivity analysis, to generate and explore potential
   energy futures and analyze the air quality and greenhouse gas emissions
   benefits of offshore wind as an energy source. The analysis shows that
   offshore wind capacity was added due to cost reductions more than CO2
   cap stringency, though both increased capacity additions. Capacity
   varied more by CO2 cap stringency at higher prices and less at lower
   prices. CO2 mitigation led to reductions in all five emissions
   investigated, regardless of offshore wind cost. Offshore wind-specific
   reductions were only consistent across all CO2 caps for CO2 and methane
   (CH4), though offshore wind-specific reductions were found for all
   emissions in the absence of CO2 caps. Results are presented nationally,
   analyzing the differences in adoption of offshore wind and how this
   technology provides a broader range of emission reduction options for
   the power sector.}},

Title = {{Impact of climate change on water availability and its propagation
   through the Western US power grid}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{276}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is expected to affect the availability of water for
   electricity generation, yet the propagation of climate impacts across a
   large and diverse power grid remains unexplored. In this study, we
   evaluate how projected changes in water availability affect electricity
   generation at hydroelectric and thermal power plants and how the
   coincident impacts propagate locally and throughout the interconnected
   power grid of western United States. We also evaluate whether the
   prospect of climate-driven change could affect regional power
   dependencies. Hydrologic simulations derived from three Global
   Circulation Models (CCSM4, INMCM4, and GFDL-CM3), two radiative
   scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and the VIC hydrology model are used to
   force a large-scale, distributed water management model (MOSART-WM),
   which translates water availability into power generation constraints at
   hydropower plants and water-dependent thermoelectric plants. Power
   system dynamics are evaluated using the production cost model PLEXOS. We
   find that the interregional connections across the contemporary Western
   U.S. electricity infrastructure play an essential role in managing
   variations in regional generation due to hydrological variability.
   Projected WECC-scale changes in mean annual precipitation ranging from
   -3.8\% to +17\% are moderated to -6\% to +4\% in mean annual production
   cost changes. Climate change impacts on water availability in the
   Northwest drive future changes in other regions' generation and in
   regional power flows. Northwest total generation influences interannual
   variability in other regions' net generation, explaining about 40\%,
   50\%, and 35\% of the variability in Southwest, Rockies, and Southern
   California regions respectively. The propagation of Northwest climate
   change impact throughout the grid is exacerbated by the occurrence of
   dry years in Northern California. Generation from the Desert Southwest
   emerges as a critical resource to compensate for variations in water
   availability, and generation, in these regions. Though the regional
   power flow directions seem insensitive to long-term variations in water
   availability, our analysis highlights the need to consider other
   compounding regional factors, such as changes in Southern California's
   net load and changes in regional fuel prices.}},

   Integrated into Regional Power Grid Based on Bifurcation Theory}},
Journal = {{COMPLEXITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Since wind power has characteristics such as intermittent and
   fluctuation, the integration of large-scale wind turbines into the power
   grid will bring a great impact on the voltage stability of the system.
   In this paper, the influence of the front-end speed controlled wind
   turbine (FSCWT) on the system voltage stability is studied. An actual
   model of the wind turbines, including the FSCWTs, connected to a
   regional power grid in Zhangye, Gansu Province, is established. Firstly,
   differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) describing the dynamic
   characteristics of the wind turbine are given and the mathematical model
   of the system includes FSCWT is established. The continuation method is
   used to track the balance solution of the DEAs within given parameter
   intervals. Based on that, the influence of the reactive power variation
   and wind speed fluctuation on the stability of system voltage is
   analyzed through both the bifurcation theory and the time-domain
   simulation. Results show that the Hopf bifurcation (HB) and the
   saddle-node bifurcation (SNB) are inherited for the system, indicating
   that such bifurcations are the essence of nonlinear dynamics that lead
   to voltage instability. The greater the disturbance of the bifurcation
   parameterQ(1), the shorter the time of voltage collapse and the smaller
   the stable operation area of the system. With the increase of wind
   speed, the amplitude of system voltage will increase slightly, but the
   HB point will appear in advance, which is more likely to lead to voltage
   instability and further reduce the stable operation area of system
   voltage.}},

Abstract = {{The study objective was to develop and use the Water-Energy-Food Nexus
   Phosphate (WEF-P) Tool to evaluate the impact of Morocco's phosphate
   industry on water, energy, and food sectors of Khouribga, which is the
   representative phosphate mining region of Morocco. The developed WEF-P
   Tool enabled a trade-off analysis based on integrating supply-chain
   processes, transportation, and water-energy footprints of the region.
   Field data from the mining to transportation processes were collected
   and applied to possible supply-chain scenarios in accordance with the
   type of product (phosphate rock and slurry). The potential impacts of
   the scenarios were considered in terms of the water supply in the
   agricultural areas. The analysis of the positive impacts of dynamic
   management suggests that seasonal management of phosphate production
   (less during the irrigated season, more during wetter or rainier
   seasons) is more effective. Additionally, while the transport of raw
   phosphate slurry through a pipeline increased the total water required
   to 34.6 x 10(6) m(3), which is an increase of 76\% over the ``business
   as usual{''} (BAU) scenario, it also resulted in an energy savings of
   nearly 80\% over BAU: slurry transport requires only 40.5 x 10(6) L of
   fossil fuel instead of the 204 x 10(6) L required to transport rocks.
   During the dry or ``water-scarce{''} irrigation season (May to July),
   total groundwater use decreased from 5.8 x 10(6) to 5.2 x 10(6) m(3).
   Dynamic management of the phosphate industry can also save 143 MWh
   (megawatt-hour) of electricity annually and can bring a reduction of 117
   t of CO2 emissions. Making water available at the correct season and
   location requires analysis of complex scientific, technical,
   socioeconomic, regulatory, and political issues. The WEF-P Tool can
   assist by assessing user-created scenarios; thus, it is an effective
   management-decision aid for ensuring more sustainable use of limited
   resources and increased reliability of water resources for both
   agricultural and industrial use. This study on the applications of WEF
   Nexus to the phosphate industry offers a roadmap for other industrial
   application for which trade-offs between the primary resources must be
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the drought characteristics is critical for water
   resources management in water stressed countries such as India. Previous
   studies evaluating drought assessments over India considered
   precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) as drivers
   using standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The
   suitability of actual evapotranspiration (AET), which accounts for both
   water and energy based evaporative demands, in drought characterization
   is limited. In this study, SPEI is restructured with AET to characterize
   the regional drought over water and energy limited regions as
   standardized precipitation actual evapotranspiration index (SPAEI). For
   this, AET estimated based on Budyko framework and remote sensing-based
   AET data has been used. The original formulation of SPEI is limited
   toward capturing the seasonality present in P and PET. The SPEI is
   restructured to account for the water availability deficit in the
   drought assessment rather than the actual atmospheric water demand in a
   given period to capture the strong seasonality of rainfall. The study
   compared the drought characteristics with both PET and AET for various
   meteorological homogeneous zones of India, which are characterized as
   water-limited (Central, North, West, South, and Jammu and Kashmir, J\&K)
   and energy-limited (Northeast and Northeast hills) zones. Overall, the
   proposed new drought index based on AET can be promising toward drought
   intensity, extreme drought areal extents, shorter-time scale drought
   frequencies, and longer-time scale drought durations for water-limited
   zones. The proposed drought indices based on AET can be robust for the
   drought assessment under consideration of water energy along with land
   and vegetation variability and can provide more insights for
   water-limited regions.}},

Abstract = {{With the implementation of China's ``Going Out{''} strategy and ``Belt
   and Road Initiative{''} (BRI) as well as the shortage of domestic
   hydropower market, the scale of hydropower investment along BRI by
   Chinese companies has expanded rapidly. However, these countries have
   great differences in politics, laws, economy, hydropower potential,
   social development and environmental constraints. Due to the
   inappropriate choice of countries for investment, many failure cases
   have also occurred. To specifically evaluate hydropower investment in
   these countries, this paper proposed a six-dimensional indicator system
   which can represents the characteristics of hydropower investment along
   BRI based on the analysis of the typical cases of overseas investment by
   Chinese enterprises. Furthermore, a fuzzy optimal model based on the
   Delphi-Entropy weight was constructed to evaluate the hydropower
   investment of 65 countries along BRI as well as a list of countries and
   corresponding investment grades are proposed. The result indicates that
   politics and hydropower industry factors are the key determinants of
   choosing the countries for conducting investment while legal, economic,
   social and environmental factors should also be covered. In conclusion,
   the optimal choices for China's hydropower investment along BRI are
   Russia, Pakistan, Malaysia, Kazakhstan and Indonesia and the strategy
   has been given accordingly. Moreover the policy recommendations from the
   perspective of nation and enterprise level have also been proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling and preventing soil erosion on slope surfaces is a pressing
   concern worldwide, and at the same time, there is a growing need to
   incorporate sustainability into our engineering works. This study
   evaluates the efficiency of bioengineering techniques in the development
   of vegetation in soil slopes located near a hydroelectric power plant in
   Brazil. For this purpose, twelve different bioengineering techniques
   were evaluated, in isolation and in combination, in the slopes (10 m
   high) of two experimental units (approximately 70 m long each) located
   next to the Paraiba do Sul riverbanks, in Brazil. High-resolution images
   of the slopes' frontal view were taken in 15-day interval visits in all
   units for the first 90 days after implantation, followed by monthly
   visits up to 27 months after the works were finished. The images were
   treated and analyzed in a computer algorithm that, based on three-color
   bands (red-green-blue scale), helps to assess the temporal evolution of
   the vegetative cover index for each technique adopted. The results
   showed that most of the solutions showed a deficiency in vegetation
   establishment and were sensitive to climatological conditions, which
   induced changes in the vegetation phytosanitary aspects. Techniques
   which provided a satisfactory vegetative cover index throughout the
   investigated period are pointed out.}},

Abstract = {{The Himalayas have become synonymous with the hydropower developments
   for larger electricity demands of India's energy sector. In the Himachal
   Himalayas though, there are only three large storage dams with more than
   1000 megawatts (hereafter MW) capacity that have very serious
   environmental issues. However, hundreds of small runoff-river hydropower
   plants across the Himachal Himalayas are a serious threat to the river
   regimes and Himalayan biota. There are 965 identified hydropower
   projects (hereafter HPPs) having a potential capacity of 27,436 MW in
   the Himachal Pradesh as of December 2019 as per the Directorate of
   Energy of the state. Out of the 965 identified, 216 are commissioned,
   including less than 5 MW plants, with an installed capacity of 10,596
   MW, and were operational by December 2019. Only 58 projects are under
   construction among the identified with an installed capacity of 2351 MW,
   640 projects are in various stages of clearance and investigation with
   an installed capacity 9260 MW, 30 projects are to be allotted with 1304
   MW installed capacity, and merely four projects are disputed/cancelled
   with installed capacity of 50.50 MW. The large number of HPPs are
   sanctioned without proper consideration of negative environmental and
   geohazard impacts on the Himalayan terrestrial biota. In this work, our
   focus was on the hydropower and climate change impact on the Himalayan
   river regimes of the Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas, the Satluj, and the
   Yamuna river basins. We analyzed basin-wise rainfall, temperature, and
   soil moisture data from 1955 to 2019 to see the trend by applying the
   Mann-Kendall test, the linear regression model, and Sen's slope test. A
   basin-wise hazard zonation map has been drawn to assess the disaster
   vulnerability, and 12 hydropower sites have been covered through the
   primary survey for first-hand information of local perceptions and
   responses owing to hydropower plants.}},

Abstract = {{The Altai-Uliastai regional power system (AURPS) is a regional power
   system radially interconnected to the power system of Mongolia. The 110
   kV interconnection is exceptionally long and susceptible to frequent
   trips because of weather conditions. The load-rich and low-inertia AURPS
   must be islanded during interconnection outages, and the under-frequency

   Traditional UFLS over-sheds local demand, negatively affecting the local

   research paper proposes a novel methodology to optimally calculate the
   settings of the UFLS scheme, where each parameter of the scheme is
   individually adjusted to minimise the total amount of disconnected load.
   This paper presents a computationally efficient methodology that is
   illustrated in a specially created co-simulation environment (DIgSILENT

Abstract = {{Water, energy, and food are the most important basic resources for
   economic and social development. In the context of global population
   growth, environmental degradation, and resource shortages, the
   interrelationship between the water, energy, and food has become
   increasingly important. In this paper, the city of Ordos in China was
   selected as a study area. Firstly, this paper sorted out relevant
   research literature and fully understood the concept of
   water-energy-food (WEF) nexus. Then, an optimization model of WEF system
   was constructed based on interval number multi-objective programming,
   which took the comprehensive coordination deviation degree of the WEF
   system security and carbon dioxide emission minimization as the target.
   At the same time, the optimization model was constructed with full
   consideration of constraints such as economic benefit, water resource
   consumption, energy production, food production and environmental
   pollution emission. The results showed that the production of coal,
   thermal power, hydropower, wind power, and food all show an upward
   trend. Among them, the production of hydropower has the largest change,
   and the food production has the smallest change. In terms of water
   resource utilization, food production has the largest allocation of
   water resources accounting for nearly 80\%, followed by coal production,
   thermal power generation and hydropower generation. The smallest
   allocation is natural gas. In particular, the allocation of water for
   coal production and hydroelectric power generation has increased
   significantly. Finally, the policy recommendations were put forward to
   promote the sustainable development of WEF system in Ordos. The
   optimization research on the WEF system can help to ensure the WEF
   system security in Ordos and promote the sustainable development of WEF
   system, which also can provide reference for other regions.}},

Abstract = {{Unsteady flow induced by hydropower stations exerts a significant impact
   on the water level in multi-approach channels, which directly threatens

   level fluctuations at the entrance of multi-approach channels and the
   lower lock head of a ship lift with consideration of initial water
   surface elevation, base flow, flow amplitude, regulation time, and

   successfully identified; and the fluctuations at the approach channel
   entrance and the lower lock head of a ship lift under single-peak and
   double-peak regulating mode are analyzed considering the flow regulating
   of the Gezhouba Hydropower Station (GHS), thus, the water level
   oscillation process in the multi-approach channels is presented. Results
   show that the largest wave amplitude in the multi-approach channels
   manifests under unfavorable conditions including lower initial water
   surface elevation, smaller base flow, larger flow variation, and shorter
   regulation time; and water level fluctuation in the multi-approach
   channel is primarily induced by flow amplitude and net flow between the
   Three Gorges Hydropower Station (TGHS) and the GHS, with consideration
   of the counter-regulation process of the GHS. This research contributes
   to providing a reference for a similar large-scale cascade hydropower

Abstract = {{The increase in economic activities, population and rural
   electrification has significantly increased the energy demand in most of
   the developing nations. This demand has to be supplied from various
   sources, preferably renewable, among which hydropower is expected to be
   one of the major contributors. Though developed nations have already
   harnessed most of their hydropower potential, developing nations are
   still struggling in project identification and capacity assessment,
   mainly due to lack of data and difficulties of access. We present and
   test an assessment framework, developed for data scarce regions, to
   identify optimal location and installed capacity of multiple
   run-of-river hydropower projects within a river basin. The developed
   framework consists of two components: the first component is a
   hydrological model for flow duration curves, the second component is a
   so-called hydropower model. Flow duration curves are obtained using an
   existing probabilistic hydrological model which derives the probability
   distribution of streamflow as a function of few topographic and climatic
   parameters. A novel optimization procedure is developed, where viable
   hydropower projects are identified minimizing their specific cost, which
   depends mainly on discharge, head and length of conduit system. We
   tested the assessment framework in the West Rapti basin (Nepal). The
   application showed that the total potential of this basin maybe achieved
   with 79 different projects with capacity ranging from 1 to 17 MW. The
   framework was developed using open languages and software and can
   therefore be freely used after request to the corresponding author. (C)

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{145}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{To increase acceptance and reduce opposition towards power grid
   expansion, various opportunities for citizen participation have been
   implemented within grid-expansion-related planning procedures. Previous
   studies have found that residents' participation can lead to an increase
   in acceptance and a reduction in conflict, particularly if the
   participation processes are perceived as fair and just. A question that
   has not been answered sufficiently so far, however, is why residents
   participate in information and participation measures offered throughout
   the planning process of transmission line projects. This question is
   addressed in the present study. On the basis of the `Civic Voluntarism
   Model', this study derives research propositions on potential
   determinants of participation and empirically tests them by drawing on
   data collected from residents in two German regions affected by grid
   expansion. The results show that specific resources available to
   residents, psychological motivation factors, and recruiting social
   networks can significantly influence the probability of participation.
   Since the studies in both regions arrived at very similar results, the
   findings possess a high degree of external validity. Overall, the study
   presents novel insights into the mechanisms of citizen participation in
   power grid planning and provides policymakers, regulators, and

Abstract = {{We used a High-Resolution Assimilation Dataset of the water-energy cycle
   in China (HRADC) to study the land-atmosphere interactions and
   meteorological characteristics in inhomogeneous underlying surface of
   the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Three different underlying surfaces
   (i.e., grassland, open shrubland, and barren or sparsely vegetated) of
   the QTP are selected and the meteorological elements on each underlying
   surface grid are averaged. We compared and analyzed the Green Vegetation
   Fraction, precipitation, soil moisture and soil temperature, and energy
   fluxes for three different land-use types in QTP. The results showed
   that the vegetation coverage of HRADC showed a gradual decrease trend
   from southeast to northwest throughout the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The
   Green Vegetation Fraction of the grassland in the southeast can reach
   more than 60\% in summer, and only about 20\% in sparse vegetation
   areas. HRADC can well reproduce the seasonal change trend of soil
   temperature and soil moisture in different underlying surfaces. The
   annual variation trend of soil temperature shows that the time of the
   deep soil temperature reaching the peak value lags behind the shallow
   layer. The annual averaged soil moisture over grassland is higher than
   that of open shrubland and barren land, which is consistent with the
   plateau precipitation distribution. The peak value of sensible heat flux
   over grassland is only 80 W center dot m(-2)in April, and the latent
   heat flux can reach 90 W center dot m(-2), and the net radiation of the
   barren land can reach 210 W center dot m(-2)in July. This study is
   important to discover the water-energy cycle characteristics of QTP.}},

Abstract = {{This paper offers a novel method of power system load forecasting (PSLF)
   for regional special event days (RSEDs) when the load demand is highly
   prejudiced by societal considerations like cultural or religious
   rituals. These rituals abruptly change the consumer behaviors (demand
   variations) and it makes the load profile of such RSEDs more complex and
   nonlinear than normal holidays. Therefore, during RSEDs, an accurate
   PSLF method must integrate these consumer behaviors in the forecasting
   process. For this purpose, the offered method uses a new concept of
   similarity. The offered method is based on support vector machine (SVM)
   hybridized with a new algorithm called grey wolf optimizer (GWO) to
   access the proper parameter combinations of SVM for PSLF on RSEDs. This
   research is carried out in Assam and the novel method is designed to
   forecast electric power load demand in three RSEDs called Rongali Bihu,
   Durga Puja, and Diwali. The forecasting results of the offered method
   demonstrate superior accuracy while compared to the traditional method
   of training the PSLF system on the data of recent holidays. The efficacy

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{104}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The geological conditions of the underground caverns in the Jinping I
   hydropower station are particularly complicated, with high ground stress
   (the extreme value of the measuring point is 35.7 MPa), complicated
   deformation and failure mechanisms, and large unloading depth. The large
   deformation of the surrounding rock mass was beyond current engineering
   and academic understanding. During the construction period, the
   deformation and failure mechanisms were complex, and the unloading depth
   was large. The maximum deformation of the sidewall of the main
   powerhouse reached 246 mm. The monitoring results of multi-point
   extensometers basically converged two years after the completion of
   cavern excavation. Regarding the deformation and failure mechanism of
   the large underground caverns, the energy dissipation theory that can
   better describe the complex mechanical response analysis was proposed.
   The deformation failure mechanism, mechanical behaviour, supporting
   effect and stability evaluation of the large underground caverns were
   investigated from the perspectives of excavation unloading and energy
   dissipation and release. The excavation unloading-induced relaxation
   characteristics of the surrounding rock mass were analysed using a
   comprehensive approach incorporating the results of borehole television,
   acoustic wave testing, multipoint extensometer and numerical
   simulations. A criterion of the surrounding rock mass delineation
   incorporating the energy dissipation ratio, acoustic wave testing, wave
   velocity variation and elastic modulus variation was also proposed.
   Furthermore, the phenomena and law of deformation and failure of
   surrounding rock mass in the large underground caverns were revealed.
   The stability of surrounding rock mass in the underground caverns was
   evaluated. The related achievements can provide some references for
   similar deep underground rock engineering.}},

   energy system for remote rural electrification, via a case study of a
   village in West China by performing simulation, optimization and
   sensitivity analysis. Daily and seasonal characteristics of energy
   supply as well as demand sizes and patterns of remote rural areas are
   considered. Different combinations of PV panels, wind turbine and biogas
   generator are modeled and optimized in Hybrid Optimization Model for
   Electric Renewables (HOMER). The most cost competitive configuration is
   determined whilst ensuring a reliable power supply featuring
   residential, community, commercial and agricultural demand of the
   village. Comparison of the off-grid hybrid power system and grid
   extension has been carried out. Results show that a hybrid power system
   comprising solar, wind and biomass is a reliable and cost-effective
   option for sustainable remote rural electrification whilst achieving
   environmental benefits. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, with the socio-economic development, energy production
   and water consumption have been given more and more scientific,
   political and public concern. Taking Hebei Province, China as, an
   example, this paper performs an in-depth analysis of the energy
   production and water consumption. In this study, the water withdrawals
   and water consumption associated with energy production in Hebei
   Province from 2015 to 2050 were estimated by using the bottom-up
   Long-range Energy Alternative Planning model, which established three
   scenarios based on three different development models. The results show
   that the energy production and their associated water requirements would
   continue to grow at a high speed in the Reference Scenario. The energy
   production and their associated water withdrawals and water consumption
   were found to have decreased sharply in the coordinated development
   scenario and the strong emission reduction scenario compared to the
   reference scenario. It shows that industrial restructuring, energy
   structure optimization and the renewable energy replacement have played
   an important role in energy-efficient and water-efficient in coordinated
   development scenario and strong emission reduction scenario. Further
   coordinated management policy on water and energy should be fully

Abstract = {{The economic dispatch of the inter-regional power grid with multiple
   uncertain sources and loads is focused in this study. As the tie-line
   can transmit the power between regional grids, a coordination mechanism
   between the tie-line power schedule and the economic dispatch of
   regional power grids is built to solve the focused dispatch problem
   under the uncertain environment. Furthermore, the quality of service
   (QoS) method is introduced in this study to consider and study the
   service attribute in the power dispatch process, which is quantified by
   the responding behaviour of the price-sensitive consumers. Then, a
   model-free hierarchical optimisation method based on the learning
   technique is designed. The hierarchical structure consists of two levels
   and multiple agents, where the agents learn knowledge from the
   interaction between themselves and the environment. An improved
   reinforcement learning algorithm is adopted to find the optimal dispatch
   policy for each agent, which realises an online optimisation with the
   operation samples rather than the support of an accurate system model.
   Finally, the simulation results are shown to validate the effectiveness
   of the designed method. Specifically, the optimisation process and the
   obtained dispatch policies are analysed, and the impact of the QoS index
   on the optimisation is introduced.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the security of basic resources such as water, energy, and
   food is regarded as essential for sustainable development. Nonetheless,
   population growth, economic development, and changing consumption
   patterns have caused stress on these resources. It is expected that, in
   the near future, in many parts of the world, it will be challenging to
   satisfy the demand of the population and the access to essential
   services. Assessing the availability and access to natural resources
   allows for making projections of future scenarios and, in this sense,
   developing policies to mitigate deficiencies in all these sectors. This
   work presents an approach to assess the progress on the
   water-energy-food nexus security through an index that involves
   availability, accessibility, and sustainability indicators of a region
   over a time period. The evaluation considering the Sustainable
   Development Goals allows for identifying vulnerabilities associated with
   the water-energy-food nexus. The state of Sonora in Mexico was selected
   as a case study because of its unequal distribution and accessibility of
   resources. Results show that water, energy, and food access is not at
   risk, but the importation of resources to meet the demand of the state
   makes the nexus unsustainable because the availability of resources is
   not enough to satisfy the services of the population. Nevertheless,
   projections for 2030 show slight improvements in the water-energy-food
   nexus security.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Increased aridity and drought risks are significant global concerns.
   However, there are few comprehensive studies on the related risks with
   regard to the differences between relatively weak levels of warming,
   including the recent targets of the United Nations Framework Convention
   on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of 1.5 degrees C or 2 degrees C. The present
   study investigates the impacts of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming
   on aridification and their non-linearity based on the relationship
   between available water and energy at the Earth's terrestrial surface.
   Large multi-model ensembles with a 4000-model-year in total are sourced
   from the Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis, and Projected
   Impacts (HAPPI) project. Results demonstrate that 2 degrees C warming
   results in more frequent dry states in the Amazon Basin, western Europe,
   and southern Africa, and a limited warming to 1.5 degrees C will
   mitigate aridification and increase the frequency of extreme dry-year in
   these regions. In the Mediterranean region, a significant acceleration
   of aridification is found from the 1.5 degrees C to 2 degrees C warming
   projections, which indicates a need to limit the warming by 1.5 degrees
   C. A substantial portion of Asia is projected to become increasingly
   humid under both 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming scenarios. In
   some geographic regions, such as Australia, a strong nonlinear shift of
   aridification is found as 2 degrees C warming results in shift to wetter
   state contrast to significant increases in aridity and dry-year
   frequency at the weaker level of warming. The results suggest that the
   responses of regional precipitation to global warming cause the aridity
   changes, but their nonlinear behaviors along with different warming
   levels should be assessed carefully, in particular, to incorporate the
   additional 0.5 degrees C warming.}},

Abstract = {{Water, energy, and food, as the basic material resources of human
   production and life, play a prominent role in social and economic
   development. As the imbalance between the supply and demand of water,
   energy, and food increases, a highly sensitive and fragile relationship
   gradually forms among water, energy, and food. In this paper, Inner
   Mongolia in China is selected as a research area. Firstly, synergy
   theory is applied to establish the framework of a water-energy-food
   system. Then, a multi-objective programming model is constructed, where
   the objective functions are defined to minimize the integrated deviation
   degree and pollutant emissions of the water-energy-food system.
   Meanwhile, maximization of the water benefit, energy production, and
   food production is also considered. In addition, the model takes
   economy, environment, water, energy, and food as constraints. Finally, a
   genetic algorithm is designed for accurately assessing the most
   promising results. The results show that the cooperation degree of the
   water-energy-food system in Inner Mongolia is getting better and better,
   and the pollutant emission from the water-energy-food system is
   decreasing. In 2020, the proportion of agricultural water consumption
   fell by 1\%, while that of industrial water consumption rose by 0.48\%.
   The production of coal, natural gas, and power are all showing an
   increasing trend. Among them, the increase of natural gas production is
   as high as 38,947,730 tons of standard coal. However, the proportions of
   coal, natural gas, and power change inconsistently, where the
   proportions of coal and natural gas increase while that of power
   decreases. Corn production accounts for more than 80\% of the total,
   which is in the eldest brother position in the food industry structure.
   Besides, there are differences between the planned values and optimal
   values of decision variables. Finally, suggestions are put forward to
   improve the sustainable development of water-energy-food in Inner
   Mongolia.}},

Abstract = {{This work explores the application of the Water-Energy Nexus concept for

   and demand drivers and their influence on energy use are examined. This
   study found that there is limited literature available on the
   operationalization of the concept, and energy use is not considered a
   key performance indicator by water regulators and utilities. Regionally,
   most of the studies were carried out in the northern and southern
   Africa, where energy demand for water supply through desalination is
   high. An analysis of water supply and demand drivers show diminishing
   quantities of available freshwater, and increased anthropogenic
   pollutant loads in some areas are projected. Consequently, utilities
   will likely consider alternative energy-intensive water supply options.
   Increased population growth with the highest global urban growth rate is
   projected, with about 60\% of the total population in Africa as urban
   dwellers by 2050. This implies huge growth in water demand that calls
   for investment in technology, infrastructure, and improved understanding
   of energy use and optimization, as the largest controllable input within

Abstract = {{Under the increasingly serious energy and water resources crisis, the
   correlation between two resources has become more and more close.
   Promoting the sustainable development of energy and water resources has
   been an inevitable choice for regional energy system planning. In this
   study, a hybrid interval two-stage fuzzy credibility constrained
   programming (ITFCP) model is developed for supporting energy-water nexus
   system management. ITFCP can explicitly address system uncertainties
   presented as probability distributions, fuzzy sets, and intervals, as
   well as dual dynamics through the concept of solutions with interval
   membership function. The method could provide effective linkages between
   predefined policies and economic penalties as well as system economy and
   risk. Then, ITFCP is applied to electric power system management under
   considering energy-water nexus in Tangshan City, which is a typical
   resource-based, high pollution, and water-deficient region in China.
   Multiple scenarios of different credibility levels about water
   availability are designed. Results disclosed that coal-fired power and
   imported electricity would play primary role in meeting tremendous
   electricity demand under the current situation. Results also revealed
   that the total water consumption control would be an effective way to
   accelerate electric power structural adjustment, protect energy and
   water resources as well as improve atmospheric environment. These
   findings are valuable for decision makers to gain in-depth analysis for
   more reasonable and applicable development patterns within a complex

Abstract = {{The integration of high-proportion new energy into regional power grid

Abstract = {{We quantify the heavily oil-dominated WEF nexus in three Gulf
   Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia)
   across spatial scales and over time, using available empirical data at
   the national level, and explore the exposure to nexus stresses
   (groundwater depletion) in other countries through virtual water trade.
   At the domestic scale, WEF trade-offs are fairly limited; while all
   sectors require considerable amounts of energy, the requirements for
   water and food production are modest compared to other uses. At the
   international scale, revenues from oil exports in the GCC allow the
   region to compensate for low food production and scarce water
   availability. This dependency is dynamic over time, increasing when oil
   prices are low and food prices are high. We show how reducing domestic
   trade-offs can lead to higher exposure internationally, with rice
   imports originating in regions where groundwater is being depleted.
   However, Saudi Arabia's increased wheat imports, after reversing its
   food self-sufficiency policy, have had limited effects on groundwater
   depletion elsewhere. Climate change mitigation links the WEF nexus to
   the global scale. While there is great uncertainty about future
   international climate policy, our analysis illustrates how
   implementation of measures to account for the social costs of carbon
   would reduce the oil and gas revenues available to import food and
   desalinate water in the GCC.}},

   consumption. For water resources, the per capita water withdrawal and
   consumption of the highest-income urban residents reached 481.21 m(3)

   residents. 2) We identified medium and medium-high income urban
   residents as the key groups of residents. From the perspective of the
   industrial sectors, the key sectors for high energy consumption and
   water usage included the Electricity and Agricultural sectors, and we
   identified the Electricity sector as the key sector for the water and

Title = {{Advantage analysis of variable-speed pumped storage units in renewable
   energy power grid: Mechanism of avoiding S-shaped region}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{120}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Pumped storage units (PSU) as the most efficient energy storage device
   (ESD) play an important role in absorbing renewable energy (RE) sources.
   Nevertheless, pump-turbines have inherent S-shaped characteristics
   caused by their reversible design which seriously threaten the operation
   stability of PSU. In recent years, the variable-speed pumped storage
   units (VSU) have been proposed as an alternative to the fixed-speed
   pumped storage units (FSU). Therefore, it is a meaningful subject to
   evaluate the operation advantage of VSU, which has not been adequately
   quantified. This paper aims to analyse the advantages of VSU in
   operation stability by revealing the mechanism of avoiding trapping in
   the S-shaped region. Firstly, a precise coupling model for VSU with
   nonlinear pump-turbine characteristics is established and the operation
   areas in turbine mode are analysed. Then, the mechanism of how the trap
   of S-shaped region could be avoided is revealed and the regulation
   performance of the control system is quantified by comparing with FSU.
   Based on a real Chinese VSU, three scenarios are studied, including
   turbine start-up process, power regulation and turbine closing process.
   The results indicate that the S-shaped region could be escaped
   effectively by operating the VSU. The periodic oscillations times and
   setting time index of rotational speed in turbine start-up process are
   0.5 and 20.74 s respectively, which are much smaller than the values of
   FSU. VSU outperforms the FSU in the aspect of power regulation
   performance: much smaller average and standard deviation of power
   difference for wind and load disturbance. Moreover, VSU can also obtain
   a significantly higher assessment in closure process: the maximum water
   pressure deviation is only 40\% of FSU.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes effective evidence on the correlation between trend

   into the analysis of the power system blackout sequence to demonstrate
   their prominent long-time correlations. It also verifies the probability
   distribution of load loss about blackout size in the China power grid
   has a tail feature, which shows that the time series of blackouts in the
   China power grid is consistent with SOC. Meanwhile, a kind of
   mathematical statistics analysis is presented to prove that there is a
   seasonal trend of blackouts, and the blackout frequency and blackout
   size have not decreased over time but have an upward trend in the China
   power grid, thereby indicating that blackout risk may be increasing with
   time. The last 34 years' data samples of power failure accidents in the

Title = {{A perspective on e-flows at hydroelectric projects in Canada}},
Journal = {{HYDROBIOLOGIA}},
Abstract = {{Setting e-flows (instream, environmental or ecological flow regimes) for
   existing or new hydroelectric and other projects is a key worldwide
   consideration. A Canadian perspective and experience in arriving at
   e-flow regimes for ice-free or ice-covered rivers, with emphasis on
   small and large hydroelectric projects, is presented through general
   concepts and modeling approaches. Rather than a single standard
   approach, several methodologies are used throughout Canada, although in
   some regions preferred techniques may be favoured. Methods range from
   relatively simple desktop calculations based primarily on hydrological
   data to sophisticated hydrodynamic and habitat modeling followed by time
   series analyses. Method complexity usually depends on impact severity,
   particularly on fish and fish habitat. Multi-jurisdictional,
   legislative, climatic (e.g. ice regimes) and geographic landscapes
   present unique challenges for methods, data availability, and tools used
   to set e-flow regimes. Nature-mimicking approaches are also employed to
   enhance the ecological integrity of estimated flow regimes by imitating
   key elements of natural hydrographs and geomorphic features. More
   holistic approaches and scientific reviews may supplement studies,
   particularly when complex technical and societal issues are involved.

Abstract = {{Food, energy, and water resources, which are interconnected with one
   another, are essential to human beings and sustainable development
   goals. Existing studies have quantified direct interconnections of food,
   energy, and water (FEW) systems in China but overlooked their indirect
   and spatial interconnections through production systems of other
   products. Quantifying both the direct and indirect spatial
   interconnections of food, energy, and water systems is the basis of
   holistic FEW resource management. The spatial interconnections of the
   FEW systems within China's economic supply chains at the provincial
   level were quantified from both demand-driven and supply-push
   perspectives in this study. Results show that food and energy subsystems
   have tighter coupling relations than the other relationships in the FEW
   nexus from the demand perspective, and food and water subsystems have
   tighter coupling relations from the supply perspective. Findings of this
   study highlight the necessity of demand-side and supply-side measures by
   identifying critical final consumers and primary suppliers. For example,
   primary inputs of energy extraction sectors in Inner Mongolia, Shanxi,
   and Heilongjiang are crucial for national water withdrawals. Sustainable
   management of FEW resources in China can be better achieved through

Abstract = {{The viability of a renewable electricity system depends on a relatively
   small share of hydropower storage resources to regulate climate
   variations and the spatially uneven distribution of renewable energy. By
   spatio-temporal coordination of hydropower production over larger
   regions, the energy storage demand will be reduced and contribute to a
   ``virtual{''} energy storage gain that in Europe was found to be almost
   twice the actual energy storage capacity of hydropower reservoirs. In an
   attempt to quantify this gain, hydropower availability was simulated for
   most parts of the European continent for a 35-year period based on
   historical hydrometeorological data. The most significant benefits from
   spatio-temporal management arise at distances between 1200 and 3000 km,
   i.e., on the continental scale, which can have implications for a future
   renewable energy system at large. Furthermore, we discuss a condition
   termed ``energy-domain-specific drought{''}, which is a risk that can be
   reduced by the spatio-temporal management of power production. Virtual
   energy storage gain is not explicitly considered in the management
   models of hydropower production systems but could in principle
   complement existing management incentives.}},

Abstract = {{Small hydropower (SHP) is promoted as a pro-poor renewable energy source
   that does not have the negative social impacts of large dams. This
   article challenges these claims, using data from a household survey in

   systems in ways that reduce irrigation water availability, provoke
   changes to agricultural practices, and negatively impact river health.
   These social impacts of river fragmentation mainly occur in villages
   situated between a plant's intake and outflow. The frequency of plant
   water diversions due to continued generation in the dry season
   significantly predicts all social impacts; installed capacity of the
   plant and the quality of the village's irrigation infrastructure predict
   some impacts. Villages with strong local governance can negotiate with
   the plant to temporarily halt generation when irrigation water is
   needed, lessening social impacts. Our findings reveal that SHP plants

Journal = {{HYDROBIOLOGIA}},
Abstract = {{Because of growing interest in deploying newer very low head (VLH)
   turbine technology to generate electricity in rivers, there is a need to
   assess how fish fare in interactions with VLH turbines. We assessed
   injury and mortality rates from experimental VLH turbine entrainment of
   fish species local to the study site at Wasdell Falls on the Severn
   River, Ontario, which is one of the first such VLH installations in
   North America. Using balloon tags to recapture fish and before/after
   entrainment assessments, we found minimal injury and mortality
   differences between control (no entrainment) and treatment (entrainment)
   groups. One adult northern pike (Esox luciusLinnaeus, 1758; 1.16\% of
   total entrained fish) was killed by turbine strike. Abrasion-related
   injuries (i.e., scale loss, torn fins) were the most common form of
   injury in both control and treatment fish, which was likely attributed
   to handling and not turbine passage per se. Telemetry monitoring of a
   subset of fish revealed that post-passage mortality was low. These
   results suggest that VLH turbine entrainment has negligible effects on
   the fish species studied here, and thus, VLH turbines may be suitable
   for increasing generating capacity at low head dam sites with minimal

Abstract = {{Pakistan is a resource-constrained country facing severe power
   shortages. To address the power demand-supply gap, Pakistan has
   increased its use of fossil fuel energy sources for power generation. To
   support a lower carbon power supply Pakistan needs renewable energy
   sources such as hydropower. However, most of the water for irrigation
   and power generation in the country is derived from a watershed in a
   disputed territory shared between India and Pakistan. Construction of
   hydroelectric dams over transboundary rivers have led to concerns
   regarding their ecological impacts. In this paper, we evaluated the
   sustainability of the Bursar Hydroelectric Project, proposed on such a
   transboundary river. Emergy analysis was used to holistically determine
   the change in the intrinsic value of the local ecosystem both before and
   after the construction of the dam. The results show that the project
   would increase the qualitative value of outputs derived from the local
   ecosystem. However, it would also extract and stock significant
   resources thus decreasing the overall sustainability of the system. In
   conclusion, the construction of the subject dam has negative
   consequences for unrestricted flow of water, sediments and biomass
   downstream. Policy makers can use this study to design mitigation

Abstract = {{A few decades ago, hydroelectric projects were considered a clean source

   `C' stock in the reservoir's catchment in comparison to reservoirs
   located globally in the same eco-region which will ultimately result in
   lower GHG emission in the future. Moreover, estimated total carbon
   density of the forest species was found as 54.92 +/- 18.07 MgC.ha(-1)
   while mean SOC was 79.64 +/- 19.32 MgC.ha(-1). The average total `C'

   134.56 MgC.ha(-1). Moreover, ratios (total flooded carbon/installed
   capacity) comprised between 4 and304 kgC/W from the other reservoirs
   reported globally. These ratios are higher than the Tehri reservoir
   (0.28 kgC/W) as flooded area of Tehri reservoir during impoundment was
   52 km(2). Thus, Tehri reservoir was found to emit less GHG in time to

Abstract = {{Studying the pattern of species richness is crucial in understanding the
   diversity and distribution of organisms in the earth. Climate and human
   influences are the major driving factors that directly influence the
   large-scale distributions of plant species, including gymnosperms.
   Understanding how gymnosperms respond to climate, topography, and
   human-induced changes is useful in predicting the impacts of global
   change. Here, we attempt to evaluate how climatic and human-induced
   processes could affect the spatial richness patterns of gymnosperms in
   China. Initially, we divided a map of the country into grid cells of 50
   x 50 km(2)spatial resolution and plotted the geographical coordinate
   distribution occurrence of 236 native gymnosperm taxa. The gymnosperm
   taxa were separated into three response variables: (a) all species, (b)
   endemic species, and (c) nonendemic species, based on their
   distribution. The species richness patterns of these response variables
   to four predictor sets were also evaluated: (a) energy-water, (b)
   climatic seasonality, (c) habitat heterogeneity, and (d) human
   influences. We performed generalized linear models (GLMs) and variation
   partitioning analyses to determine the effect of predictors on spatial
   richness patterns. The results showed that the distribution pattern of
   species richness was highest in the southwestern mountainous area and
   Taiwan in China. We found a significant relationship between the
   predictor variable set and species richness pattern. Further, our
   findings provide evidence that climatic seasonality is the most
   important factor in explaining distinct fractions of variations in the
   species richness patterns of all studied response variables. Moreover,
   it was found that energy-water was the best predictor set to determine
   the richness pattern of all species and endemic species, while habitat
   heterogeneity has a better influence on nonendemic species. Therefore,
   we conclude that with the current climate fluctuations as a result of
   climate change and increasing human activities, gymnosperms might face a
   high risk of extinction.}},

Abstract = {{The global energy system changes towards renewables-dominated and
   liberalized markets. This requires making novel trade-offs between the

   how these future changes will affect the natural flow regime and
   identify future changes on previously overlooked levels. We found that
   damming and discharging based on market prices leads to first- and
   second-level deviation from natural flows. Beyond these effects, we
   identified a third level of distance from natural flow. This third level
   is created by the transition towards a renewables-dominated energy
   system. The volatile energy input from renewables incentivizes
   hydropower plant operators to discharge based on more flexible trading
   behavior. We conclude that novel economic models be combined with
   tailored implementations of environmental flows. This will allow to find
   novel solutions for the trade-off between market liberalization and

Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Forest harvesting and hydropower dams can significantly affect flow
   regimes (magnitude, timing, duration, frequency, and variability),
   resulting in changes in degraded aquatic ecosystems and unstable water
   supply. Despite numerous studies on the effects of forest harvesting on
   mean flows, the impact of forest harvesting on flow regimes has been
   less investigated. A great difficulty lies in separating the
   hydrological effect of forest harvesting from that of climate
   variability and other watershed disturbances such hydropower dams. In
   this study, the Upper Zagunao River watershed (2242 km(2)) was selected
   as an example to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of
   forest harvesting and hydropower dams on low flow regimes. The key
   findings include: (1) Forest harvesting led to a significant reduction
   in the magnitude and return period of low flows, and a significant
   increment in the variability and duration of low flows; (2) the recovery
   of low flow regimes occurred 40 years after forest harvesting as forest
   recovery processed; and (3) hydropower dams caused significant impact on
   all components of low flow regimes, e.g., a reduction in the magnitude,
   return period, and timing of low flows, and an increment in the
   variability and duration of low flows. Our findings highlight the
   negative impact of both forest harvesting and hydropower dams on low
   flow regimes in the Upper Zagunao River watershed. A watershed
   management strategy for offsetting the negative effect of hydropower
   dams on low flow regimes by restoring hydrological functions of
   subalpine forests is highly recommended in subalpine watersheds of the

Title = {{Water-food-energy challenges in India: political economy of the sugar
   industry}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Sugar is the second largest agro-based industry in India and has a major
   influence on the country's water, food, and energy security. In this
   paper, we use a nexus approach to assess India's interconnected
   water-food-energy challenges, with a specific focus on the political
   economy of the sugar industry in Maharashtra, one of the country's
   largest sugar producing states. Our work underscores three points.
   First, the governmental support of the sugar industry is likely to
   persist because policymakers are intricately tied to that industry.
   Entrenched political interests have continued policies that incentivize
   sugar production. As surplus sugar has been produced, the government
   introduced additional policies to reduce this excess and thereby protect
   the sugar industry. Second, although the sugar economy is important to
   India, sugar policies have had detrimental effects on both water and
   nutrition. Long-standing government support for sugarcane pricing and
   sales has expanded water-intensive sugarcane irrigation in low-rainfall
   areas in Maharashtra, which has reduced the state's freshwater resources
   and restricted irrigation of more nutritious crops. Despite its poor
   nutritional value, empty-calorie sugar has been subsidized through the
   public distribution system. Third, the Indian government is now
   promoting sugarcane-based ethanol production. This policy has the
   benefit of providing greater energy security and creating a new demand
   for surplus sugar in the Indian market. Our analysis shows that a
   national biofuel policy promoting the production of ethanol from
   sugarcane juice versus directly from molasses may help reduce subsidized
   sugar for human consumption without necessarily expanding water and land
   use for additional production of sugarcane.}},

Title = {{Estimating regional potential for micro-hydropower energy recovery in
   irrigation networks on a large geographical scale}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{396-406}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Micro-hydropower has been highlighted as a potential technology suitable
   for installation in irrigation networks to reduce system overpressures
   and to reduce the net energy consumption of the irrigation process.
   However, the full impact of this technology on a large regional scale is
   unknown. Artificial Neural Networks and regression models were used in
   this research to predict the energy recovery potential for
   micro-hydropower in on-demand pressurised irrigation networks across a
   large spatial scale. Predictors of energy recovery potential across
   spatial unit areas included: Irrigated land surface area, irrigation
   crop water requirements, rainfall, evapotranspiration, and mean
   topographical slope. The model was used to predict the energy recovery
   potential across the 164,000 ha of the Spanish provinces of Seville and
   Cordoba in the absence of hydraulic models. A total of 21.05 GWh was
   identified as the energy potential which could have been recovered using
   micro-hydropower during the 2018 irrigation season. This amount of
   energy would have potentially reduced the energy consumption of the
   irrigation process in this region by approximately 12.8\%. A reduction
   in energy consumption in the agriculture sector of this magnitude could
   have significant impacts on food production and climate change. The main
   novelty of this paper lies in the assessment of micro hydropower
   resources in operating irrigation networks on a large geographical
   scale, in areas where no information is available. It provides an
   approximation of the existing potential using computational methods. (C)

Abstract = {{Because of the rapid development of the economy, the shortages of water
   and energy in northern China have reached crisis levels. Solving the
   contradiction between economic development and resource constraint is a
   significant problem in China. Based on the 2000-2017 panel data of Hebei
   Province, a significant arid and semi-arid region in the north of China,
   this paper tries to create a valid path to resolve water-energy problems
   by calculating the growth driving factors of the industrial water-energy
   with LMDI Model, then plans the internal structure of the industrial
   sector through the linear programming model. The results show: (1) The
   seeking of the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) is the essential
   factor that promotes the increasing of water-energy crises; while,
   industrial sectors' structural adjustments will boost efficiency and
   performance of water and energy. (2) The primary industry in Hebei
   province plays the main key to energy conservation; meanwhile, reducing
   the proportion of crops with high water consumption is an excellent way
   to alleviate the shortage of water resources. (3) Manufacturing sectors'
   structural adjustments, especially reducing the proportion of heavy
   industry sectors, will provide an essential means to foster water-energy
   efficiency; at the same time, increasing the proportion of tertiary
   industry can well balance the relationship between economic growth and
   water energy utilization. Finally, this paper provides a possible path
   for the optimization and adjustment of industrial-economic restructuring
   through emphasizing sustainable solutions of industrial-economic
   interactions under the situation of water-energy constraint in Hebei

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY}},
Abstract = {{Water scarcity is a worldwide concern for Earth citizens. Finding new
   methods for water concentration is essential for the extension of life.
   The water issue is more intense in the regions with a warm to the
   tropical environment. Considering the cooling demand of these regions,
   which consequently requires excess energy to satisfy the cooling load,
   having a thermal system to support three concerns of the water, cooling,
   and power would be the key for the warm/hot weather areas. In the
   present study, a novel model by integration of gas turbine power cycle
   with a solar parabolic collector, a steam turbine, heat recovery, steam
   generator, multi-effect desalination, and absorption chiller is
   proposed. The suggested model is optimized through developing a
   comprehensive multi-objective function to maximize the exergy efficiency
   and minimize the cost. Using the genetic algorithm method, the model is
   optimized based on six design parameters such as condenser pressure,
   number of solar parabolic through collector rows, gas turbine and steam
   turbine inlet temperature, high and low pressure, high- and low-pressure
   pinch points. The final optimal design point of this cycle enables the
   overall exergy efficiency of 36.16\% and 188.43 \$ h(-1) of the total
   cost rate value; also, this integrated energy system provides the net
   electrical generation of 5.18 MW and the cooling load rate of 406.18 KW
   and generates 2.57 kg s(-1) of desalinated water. In this novel cycle
   solar energy is used for preheating the inflow of the combustion
   chamber. A dual pressure heat recovery exploits thermal energy of flue
   gas, which runs both desalination and multi-effect absorption system and
   circulates in simultaneous water and cooling load generation. Finally,
   by utilizing the genetic 1 algorithm, the optimal system is developed.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},

Volume = {{727}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{The water scarcity in China's coal bases is intensifying due to rapid
   development of modern coal chemical industry and inefficient water
   utilization. Previous studies on industrial water optimization were
   predominantly focused on direct water, overlooking the associated
   indirect water consumptions throughout supply chains. In this study, a
   water footprint (WF)-based allocation optimization framework is
   developed to obtain optimal solutions for water resources utilization
   constrained by quantity of water supply and coal chemical production
   related limiting factors. The framework comprises a novel WF accounting
   model especially used for the coal-to-chemical industry and a water
   allocation optimization model that integrates direct and indirect water
   consumptions. A typical major large-scale coal base in China was chosen
   as the study area. Results showed that the cradle-to-gate WF of the
   various coal-based products ranged from 2.01 m(3)/t to 70.85 m(3)/t, in
   which the internal operational and supply-chain blue WFs were the
   dominant contributors. Statistical analysis suggested that the
   volumetric WF of the coal-based products was strongly correlated with
   both market price and production stage while the variation of WF
   increased as products were further processed. Optimization result
   indicated that the maximized economic income of the products under
   current scenario was 66.23 billion CNY/year in the study area, whereas
   the overlapping of limited water resources and the insufficiency of
   downstream production capacity restricted the economic performance by
   over 20\%. In addition, sensitivity analysis was conducted and the
   results showed that, in order to improve the overall economic income,
   deployment of more advanced technologies for saving water should be
   prioritized over that for saving feedstock, while conservation of power
   was the least preferable. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a method for the post-hoc interpretation of a neural network
   (NN) trained on the global and local minima of neutral water clusters.
   We use the structures recently reported in a newly published database
   containing over 5 x 10(6) unique water cluster networks (H2O)(N) of size
   N = 3-30. The structural properties were first characterized using
   chemical descriptors derived from graph theory, identifying important
   trends in topology, connectivity, and polygon structure of the networks
   associated with the various minima. The code to generate the molecular
   graphs and compute the descriptors is available at
   https://github.com/exalearn/molecular-graph-descriptors, and the graphs
   are available alongside the original database at
   https://sites.uw.edu/wdbase/. A Continuous-Filter Convolutional Neural
   Network (CF-CNN) was trained on a subset of 500 000 networks to predict
   the potential energy, yielding a mean absolute error of 0.002 +/- 0.002
   kcal/mol per water molecule. Clusters of sizes not included in the
   training set exhibited errors of the same magnitude, indicating that the
   CF-CNN protocol accurately predicts energies of networks for both
   smaller and larger sizes than those used during training. The
   graph-theoretical descriptors were further employed to interpret the
   predictive power of the CF-CNN. Topological measures, such as the Wiener
   index, the average shortest path length, and the similarity index,
   suggested that all networks from the test set were within the range of
   values as the ones from the training set. The graph analysis suggests
   that larger errors appear when the mean degree and the number of
   polygons in the cluster lie further from the mean of the training set.
   This indicates that the structural space, and not just the chemical
   space, is an important factor to consider when designing training sets,
   as predictive errors can result when the structural composition is
   sufficiently different from the bulk of those in the training set. To
   this end, the developed descriptors are quite effective in explaining
   the results of the CF-CNN (a.k.a. the ``black box{''}) model.}},

   stability. These SRs are uniquely determined for a given network
   topology (as well as location and clearing process for transient faults)
   and given system component parameters, and are irrelevant to operation
   states. This paper presents 11 facts and related remarks to introduce
   the basic concepts, composition, dynamics nature, and topological and
   geometric characteristics of SRs. It also provides a practical
   mathematical description of SR boundaries and fast calculation methods
   to determine them in a concise and systematic way. Thus, this article
   provides support for the systematic understanding, future research, and
   applications of SRs. The most critical finding on the topological and
   geometric characteristics of SRs is that, within the scope of
   engineering concern, the practical boundaries of SRs in the power
   injection space can be approximated by one or a few hyperplanes. Based
   on this finding, the calculation time for power system probabilistic
   security assessment (i.e., risk analysis) and power system optimization
   with security constraints can be decreased by orders of magnitude. (C)

Title = {{Water scarcity footprint of hydropower based on a seasonal approach -
   Global assessment with sensitivities of model assumptions tested on
   specific cases}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{724}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{According to ISO 14046 the quantification of the water scarcity
   footprint (WSFP) of hydropower reservoirs has to consider (1) the
   evaporation of water from the surface of the reservoir, (2) the baseline
   evaporation of water of the same area before the reservoir has been
   built, and (3) the water scarcity index of the location of the reservoir
   on a spatially and temporally explicit level.
   When a reservoir has a storing function, e.g., for irrigation in the dry
   season, monthly water scarcity indexes have to be used in order to
   calculate the WSFP, since storage in wet seasons and release in dry
   seasons can counteract water scarcity and lead to a reduction of overall
   water scarcity in the watershed.
   This paper builds on previous research regarding detailed hydropower
   modeling and extends the water scarcity assessment to include and
   advance new methods for identifying sensitivities in monthly WSFP of
   hydropower due to the choice of impact assessment methods. We applied
   the global analysis to 1473 hydropower plants covering >100 countries,
   and added a detailed assessment for a subset of important power plants
   to discuss the limitations of global assessments. We thereby provide the
   most complete WSFP of global hydropower with state-of-the-art methods,
   assess the robustness of the global model and different methodological
   choices, and provide new monthly average AWARE CFs on watershed level.
   The results show that water scarcity can often be mitigated if the net
   evaporation is compensated by the storage effects. The two water
   scarcity metrics applied lead to larger differences than expected, since
   the monthly dynamics of dams can lead to stronger differences than the
   differences in the applied water scarcity factors. The new insights help
   to better understand the WSFP of hydropower and its uncertainties.<bold>

Abstract = {{As ecological civilization construction receives growing attention in
   China, the eco-friendliness of the power supply structure is becoming
   increasingly important. Thermal power and hydropower are the two major
   power sources in China. Hydropower has both positive and negative
   effects on the ecosystem. However, there are few studies on the
   comprehensive impact of hydropower on the ecosystem. Therefore, the main
   innovation of this article is to integrally and comprehensively study
   the impact of hydropower to propose recommendations for hydropower
   development. The study of hydropower's effects on the overall ecosystem
   including resources, the environment, and economic society reflects the
   integrity, and the simultaneous study of hydropower's positive and
   negative effects reflects the comprehensiveness. First, this paper
   constructs a system dynamics (SD) model that can analyze the impact of
   replacing thermal power with hydropower on the ecosystem and proposes an
   improved coupling coordination degree (CCD) model. Then, this paper
   takes the province of Fujian as an example for SD scenario simulation
   and proposes recommendations for each indicator in the ecology
   subsystem. Finally, this paper performs CCD analysis on subsystems of
   the ecology subsystem in different policy scenarios and provides
   suggestions for future hydropower development in Fujian. Results show
   that hydropower technology improvement and efficiency increase (HTIEI)
   is more conducive to the development of the overall ecosystem. The
   scientificity of the current hydropower policy in Fujian is proven
   through theoretical analysis, and further hydropower development
   proposals are proposed. This paper provides a basis for the formulation
   of power generation policies and promotes ecological civilization
   construction for Fujian. The proposed methods in this paper can also
   provide tools for policy research on clean energy power generation.}},

Abstract = {{Wave energy assessments related to wave energy convertors in the coastal
   waters of China are very scarce. Thus, based on ERA-Interim wave field
   data acquired over the past 40 years, we assessed the applicability of
   state-of-the-art wave energy convertors at key stations in the coastal
   waters of China and obtained some important conclusions that can provide
   guidance for the future siting of wave farms and the design,
   manufacturing, construction, operation, and maintenance of wave energy
   convertors. The results show that the Wave Star and Sharp Eagle Wanshan
   are the most suitable wave energy convertors according to the capacity
   factor, while the Wave Star and Wave Dragon are the most suitable
   devices according to the capture width. The dominant direction of wave
   energy transport was concentrated in the N-ENE direction. From the
   perspective of wave energy transport, the South China Sea is the most
   suitable sea area for establishing nearshore wave farms, and the
   percentages of energy available for continued development exceeded 66\%.
   Nearly all wave conditions that yielded outstanding energy contributions
   were under the storm protection state, and the energy contribution
   percentages exceeded 74\% at each station. These conditions are
   convenient for the concentrated collection and utilization of energy.

Abstract = {{Water is required throughout the life-cycle processes of energy
   production to meet the growing energy demands in China's megacities.
   However, the spatially explicit impact on water scarcity both inside and
   outside the megacity boundaries from megacities' energy demands remains
   unknown. We quantified and compared the water footprint and water
   scarcity footprint for final energy demand (WFE and WSFE) in China's
   megacities from a consumption perspective. Six acknowledged megacities,
   i.e. Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, were
   evaluated with an extended multi-region input-output model. The results
   showed that these megacities were endowed with only 2.60\% of the
   national available water resources, but their WFE (WSFE) made up nearly
   14.00\% (13.50\%) of the national total. The megacities located in
   Northern China generated a larger WSFE in their WFE than the cities in
   Southern China. Energy demands in these megacities were heavily
   dependent on scarce water sourced from beyond their administrative
   boundaries, together importing 84.10\% of WSFE from elsewhere.
   Electricity demand dominated the volumetric water consumption,
   representing 52.00\% of the WFE. The distribution was different for
   scarce water consumption, with coal demand generating 34.00\% of total
   WSFE, followed by electricity (31.00\%) and petroleum (26.00\%).
   Although Northern China is faced with dire water scarcity, its scarce
   water is still being predominantly outsourced to support energy demands
   in both Northern and Southern megacities, mainly due to their coal and
   petroleum reserves. Location-specific pathways and foci should be
   applied for different megacities to decouple their energy demands and
   their scarce water consumption.}},

   the United States vulnerable to foreign and domestic threats (both

Abstract = {{Clean development mechanism (CDM) is an important principle in CO2
   emissions mitigation since it was proposed. However, there will be a
   long way for the large-scale application of CDM in China, for thermal
   power is still in the dominant position, while renewable power is far
   from being competitive. In this study, a mix integer bi-level
   hierarchical programming model (MIBLHP) is developed to investigate the
   potential impact of the CDM application on the regional
   energy-water-carbon nexus optimization in electric power system in
   China. The model integrates the advantages of bi-level programming and
   mix integer liner programming in dealing with conflicting objectives
   with hierarchical and sequential decision making process and help to
   achieve the optimized strategies with the highest overall system
   satisfaction degree. Results show that CDM will play an important role
   in the regional energy-water-carbon nexus optimization, the MIBLHP is
   able to stabilize the increasing trend of system cost and make better
   tradeoffs between the economic and environmental goals. Optimal
   strategies including power generation and capacity expansion path,
   system cost control, CO2 emissions abatement strategies, water
   consumption and waste water discharge are presented. The system would
   reach the supreme satisfaction degrees (lambda = 0.934) when the CO2
   reduction level is 40\%, which means that every part of the system has
   achieved the best condition. The proposed model has great potential in
   dealing with similar regional planning problems in energy-water-carbon

   decreases in sensible heat flux). Some environmental factors were found
   to be under management control, whereas others were fixed as constraints
   at a given location. Irrigated crops in dry climates (e.g., maize,
   almonds) showed high predictability of fluxes given only knowledge of
   fluctuations in climate (R-2 > 0.78), and fluxes were nearly as
   predictable across strongly energy- or water-limited environments (0.60
   < R-2 < 0.89). However, wavelet regression of environmental conditions
   on fluxes showed much smaller predictability in response to
   precipitation pulses (0.15 < R-2 < 0.55), where mowing or grazing
   affected crop phenology (0.28 < R-2 < 0.59), and where water and energy
   limitations were balanced (0.7 < net radiation / precipitation < 1.3;
   0.27 < R-2 < 0.36). By incorporating a temporal component to regression,
   wavelet-statistics conjunction provides an important step forward for
   understanding direct ecosystem responses to environmental change, for
   modelling that understanding, and for quantifying nonstationary,
   nonlinear processes such as precipitation pulses, which have previously
   defied quantitative analysis.}},

Title = {{How do changes in flow magnitude due to hydroelectric power production
   affect fish abundance and diversity in temperate regions? A systematic
   review protocol}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Background Natural flow regimes are an essential component of healthy
   fluvial systems, but hydropower production alters flow components,
   disrupting natural processes and impacting species reliant on them.
   Establishing improved management of flow regimes requires a better
   understanding of how fish respond to altered flow components, such as
   flow magnitude. We recently conducted a systematic map to provide a
   summary of the existing literature base on the impacts of flow regime
   changes on direct outcomes of freshwater or estuarine fish productivity.
   Of those studies considering the impacts of flow magnitude changes due
   to hydropower, studies on fish abundance, biomass and diversity
   responses were identified as subtopics (i.e., knowledge clusters) that
   had sufficient coverage for further review. This systematic review
   proposes to estimate how fish abundance, biomass and diversity are
   affected by alterations in flow magnitude due to hydropower production.
   Methods This systematic review will use evidence identified during a
   systematic map process. An updated English language search will be
   performed using six bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, and
   networking tools to include academic and grey literature published after
   2016. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two stages: (1) title
   and abstract, and (2) full-text. We will include all studies that
   evaluate the impact of changes to (or manipulations of) flow magnitude
   due to hydropower on fish abundance, density, biomass, yield, species
   richness, composition or diversity indices. The focus of this review
   will be on the downstream fluvial effects of flow magnitude changes and
   include hydroelectric facilities where water moves via gravity or by
   active pumping. Any freshwater or estuarine fish species or species
   group in temperate regions will be considered. Included eligible studies
   will undergo a critical appraisal that will assess the internal study
   validity. We will extract information on study characteristics,
   intervention/exposure and comparator details, measured outcomes, and
   effect modifiers. A narrative synthesis will describe the quantity and
   characteristics of available evidence, and where sufficient numbers of
   similar studies are available, meta-analysis will be conducted to
   estimate an overall mean and variance of effect.}},

Abstract = {{Energy and water resources are essential to human beings, and energy and
   water systems are closely interconnected. Existing studies have
   quantified the energy-water nexus in China, but the socioeconomic
   factors that influence the provincial energy-water nexus have not been
   assessed. This study quantified the water withdrawals driven by the
   provincial final demand of energy products, and explored the driving
   factors of the provincial energy-water nexus in China from 2007 to 2012.
   The results show that actions to reduce the water withdrawals should
   focus on the changes in energy demand structure and per capita energy
   demand in economically developed and populous provinces (e.g., Beijing,
   Guangdong, and Jiangsu). For water-scarce and energy resource-abundant
   provinces (e.g., Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Anhui), the changes in
   water withdrawal intensity and production structure will have more
   impacts on water withdrawal reductions. Furthermore, the reduction of
   water withdrawals in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, and
   Anhui is highly linked to the energy demand in Beijing, Shanghai,
   Guangdong, and Jiangsu. Population growth has small effects on the
   energy-water nexus in China. Considering inter-provincial trade in
   energy-water-related policies can contribute to sustainable energy and
   water resource management in China. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Managing the water-energy-food nexus in China by adjusting critical
   final demands and supply chains: An input-output analysis}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{720}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{The rapid population growth in China has increased the demand for
   limited water, energy and food resources. Because the resource supply is
   constrained by future uncertainties such as climate change, it is
   necessary to examine the connections among water, energy and food
   resources from the perspective of the relevant final demands. Based on
   an input-output model and structural path analysis, this study aims to
   explore the hidden connections among water, energy and food resources by
   identifying important final demands and examine how these resources are
   embodied in upstream production and downstream consumption processes
   along the supply chain. The water-energy-food nexus approach in this
   research identifies where and how these resources intersect in economic
   sectors. By simultaneously considering the water, energy and food
   footprints, synergistic effects can be maximized among these resource
   systems. The results reveal that urban household consumption and fixed
   capital formation have large impacts on water-energy-food resources.
   Besides, agriculture, construction and service sectors have the largest
   water-energy-food footprints. For each resource, we rank the top-20
   supply chain paths from the final demands to the upstream production
   sectors, and six critical supply chain paths are identified as important
   contributors to the consumption of all these resources. Compared with
   independent approach to manage water, energy and food resources, the
   nexus approach identifies the critical linkages of the water, energy and
   food systems and helps to formulate integrated policies to effectively
   manage these resources across sectors and actors. Synergistic strategies
   for conserving water, energy, and food resources can be achieved through
   avoiding unnecessary waste in end uses and improving resource use
   efficiency along critical supply chains. This research can help
   consumers, industries and the government make responsible consumption
   and production decisions to conserve water, energy and food resources.

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Deforestation and fragmentation are two of the main factors responsible
   for climate change. The construction of large enterprises such as
   hydropower plants can modify landscape dynamics, boosting the urban
   centers and other economic land uses. We evaluated the landscape around
   Governador Bento Munhoz da Rocha Netto Hydropower Plant, Parana, Brazil,
   aiming to identify the land use dynamics since its construction in 1980.
   Satellite images of the years 1976, 1984 and 2016 were obtained and
   landscape and patch metrics of composition, shape, core area,
   connectivity and isolation were calculated. The deforestation conversion
   profile was also evaluated. Our results showed a reduction of forest
   areas by 18.9\%, with great replacement of forest stands. A large
   increase of small forest remnants was noted, indicating a high degree of
   landscape fragmentation and an expressive reduction of the core area.
   The deforestation profile revealed that the transformation rates were
   low, indicating gradual conversions. On the other hand, conversions of
   natural areas occurred in almost half the area in the initial years -
   which comprise the period after hydropower plant construction. Changes
   in the landscape may be related to the hydroelectric plant construction.
   However, the local economic cycle that happened naturally may have

Abstract = {{With the promotion of ecological civilization construction, the
   government has always been concerned about how to achieve technological
   innovation and upgrading, so as to better carry out emission reduction
   and environmental protection. Only through technological innovation can
   enterprises better realize water and energy saving and promote
   environmental sustainable development. As the second largest tax in
   China, corporate income tax affects the level of technological
   innovation through tax revenue and tax preference. In this paper, on the
   basis of theoretical analysis, the panel data of China from 1998 to 2017
   were used to empirically test the impact of corporate income tax on the
   dynamics of technological innovation. The results show that the
   corporate income tax has significantly promoted the technological
   innovation in U shape to some extent, which was further proved by a
   threshold regression, that is, the short-term income backwardness
   mechanism and the implementation of tax preferential policies have
   significantly improved the level of technological innovation. However,
   with the increase of the burden of technological innovation of
   enterprises and the defects of tax preferential policies, the promotion
   level has been reduced. The long-term corporate income tax has reached a
   certain scale, which ensures the financial revenue and the government's
   efforts to optimize the allocation of tax resources, reasonably
   standardizes and plays the role of preferential policies, and increases
   its promotion role.}},

Abstract = {{Whether renewable energy sources (RES) will provide sufficient energy

   We contribute to this debate by estimating the current global average

   comprehensive and internally consistent estimations of their material
   requirements at three distinct energy system boundaries: standard

   extended (including indirect investments, EROIext). EROIst levels found
   fall within the respective literature ranges. Expanding the boundaries
   closer to the system level, we find that only large hydroelectricity
   would currently have a high EROIext similar to 6.5:1, while the rest of
   variable RES would be below 3:1: onshore wind (2.9:1), offshore wind
   (2.3:1), solar Photovoltaic (PV) (1.8:1), and solar Concentrated Solar
   Power (CSP) (<1:1). These results indicate that, very likely, the global
   average EROIext levels of variable RES are currently below those of
   fossil fuel-fired electricity. It remains unknown if technological
   improvements will be able to compensate for factors, which will become
   increasingly important as the variable RES scale-up. Hence, without

   compared with the average national level, carbon intensity and water

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, rising water and energy consumption in educational
   institutions has become a topic of increasing attention among the
   scientific and policy communities. This work assesses the potential for
   water and energy savings in 100 public schools in southern Brazil. There
   was great variation in the water consumption (0.81-35.43 l/student/day)
   and also great variation in the energy consumption (0.31-66.47
   kWh/student/month). Two schools were selected for assessing the
   implementation of a rainwater harvesting system and improvements in the
   artificial lighting system. One of the schools has high water and energy
   consumption, while the other has low consumption. In the school with
   high consumption, the potential for potable water savings by using
   rainwater varied from 2996 to 5431 l/day; and the payback period ranged
   from 20 to 36 months. The potential for energy savings by improving the
   artificial lighting system was 62\%; and the payback period was just
   five months. In the school with low consumption, the potential for
   potable water savings by using rainwater ranged from 542 to 1574 l/day;
   and the payback period ranged from 46 to 83 months. As for the
   improvements in the artificial lighting system, there was an increase of
   13\% in the monthly energy consumption due to the current low
   illuminance levels in the classrooms. The results show the importance of
   choosing strategies for decreasing water and energy consumption in
   schools. Such strategies are usually economically and environmentally
   feasible, bringing significant reduction to the consumption of water and
   energy.}},

Title = {{Water usage for energy production and supply in China: Decoupled from
   industrial growth?}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{719}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{The energy industry, one of the largest water consumers in the
   socioeconomic system, has been constrained by water scarcity in some
   areas worldwide. Therefore, decoupling water usage from the energy
   system is a pressing issue for ensuring energy security and maintaining
   environmental sustainability. This study applied an inputoutput analysis
   and the Tapio decoupling index, which may be considered the first
   attempt to investigate the decoupling degree between water usage, i.e.,
   the direct water withdrawal for energy production (WWEP) from a
   production-based perspective and the water footprint for energy supply
   (WFES) from a consumption-based perspective, and industrial growth for
   five major energy sectors in China from 2002 to 2015. We found that WWEP
   was roughly three times higher than WFES for the whole energy industry,
   and both values underwent a considerable decrease during the study
   period. Production and supply of electricity and heat (PSEH) contributed
   most to the total WWEP and WFES, and was mainly responsible for the
   overall decline. Moreover, WFES exceeded WWEP in Processing of
   petroleum, coking, and processing of nuclear fuel (PPC) and Production
   and supply of gas (PSG), whose WEFS values accounted for 36.3\% and
   12.2\%, respectively, of the total WFES in 2015. In terms of the
   decoupling status, only PSEH achieved strong decoupling in both WWEP and
   WFES, while PPC and PSG presented a better decoupling performance for
   WWEP than that for WFES. In contrast. Mining and washing of coal and
   Extraction of petroleum and natural gas performed relatively worse from
   both perspectives. These results can help provide a foundation and
   support for effective water conservation policies from both energy
   production and energy consumption perspectives. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Hydroelectric reservoirs are highly regulated ecosystems, where the
   understanding on bacterioplankton has been very limited so far. In view
   of significant changes in river hydrological conditions by dam
   construction, hydraulic load (i.e., the ratio of mean water depth to
   water retention time) was assumed to control bacterioplankton diversity
   in cascading hydropower reservoirs. To evaluate this hypothesis, we
   investigated bacterioplankton composition and diversity using
   high-throughput sequencing and related environmental variables in eleven
   reservoirs on the Wujiang River, Southwest China. Our results showed a
   decrease of bacterioplankton diversity index with an increase of
   reservoir hydraulic load. This is because hydraulic load governs
   dissolved oxygen variation in the water column, which is a key factor
   shaping bacterioplankton composition in these hydroelectric reservoirs.
   In contrast, bacterioplankton abundance was mainly affected by
   nutrient-related environmental factors. Therefore, from a hydrological
   perspective, hydraulic load is a decisive factor for the
   bacterioplankton diversity in the hydroelectric reservoirs. This study
   can improve the understanding of reservoir bacterial ecology, and the
   empirical relationship between hydraulic load and bacterioplankton
   diversity index will help to quantitatively evaluate ecological effects
   of river damming.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of sustainable development is to ensure the current
   and future demand can be satisfied. Food, energy and water is the
   primary human demand. However, China is facing security issues of water,
   energy and food due to several economic, social and environmental
   impacts such as economic progress, population growth and environmental
   change. For this reason, it is important to evaluate the relationship
   between food, energy and water with sustainability aspects. Using
   Bayesian network models, we propose a quantitative analysis framework
   based on the Water-Energy-Food-Economy-Society-Environment Nexus. Under
   this framework, the causality relations between water, energy, food and
   economy, society, environment were studied and quantified. Additionally,
   the demand for water, energy, food was predicted from a perspective of
   systematic interaction. Different from previous studies, our research is
   more comprehensive, involving six subsystems. More importantly, we do
   research from a systematic point of view. Thirdly, the causality in the
   nexus was quantified. As a result, we found that water withdrawal is
   directly affected by population growth and energy demand, indirectly by
   other nodes in the nexus; energy demand is directly affected by GDP and
   population growth in the nexus; population growth is the only direct
   cause of changes in food demand. Projections show that the demand for
   water, energy and food in China will remain at {[}600,620) billion cubic
   meters, a growth rate of {[}4\%, 8\%) and {[}0\%, 5\%) with an average
   probability of 0.6772, 0.6128 and 0.7055 respectively from 2020 to 2030.

Abstract = {{Fish entrainment and mortality at hydropower generating stations
   constitute a major concern for power producers and government agencies.
   The American Shad Alosa sapidissima is particularly at risk at higher
   latitudes because of the large percentage of repeat spawners and the
   vulnerability of many populations. Total or partial turbine shutdowns at
   powerhouses and concurrent increased spillage are generally considered
   an effective way to enable fish to bypass the turbines and to reduce
   associated mortality, but this strategy is unappealing to hydropower
   producers because of the loss of power generation revenue. Two
   approaches were tested to repel out-migrating adult American Shad from
   the turbine intakes of the Riviere-des-Prairies Generating Station
   powerhouse and guide them toward the adjacent spillway. The first
   approach consisted of shutting down the powerhouse and increasing
   spillage. The second approach consisted of testing the effectiveness of
   an ultrasonic field to deter American Shad from getting close to turbine
   intakes and to guide them toward the partially opened spillway. On
   average, fish density observed in front of the 54-MW powerhouse was
   reduced by 93\% as a result of a powerhouse shutdown lasting about 1 h
   and a concurrent spillage increase. Similarly, our results showed a
   decrease in shad abundance of 78-90\% in front of the turbine intakes
   when a pulsed ultrasonic field (125 kHz) was activated. Measurements of
   sound pressure levels (SPLs) in the forebay suggested that the deterrent
   effect could be perceived by American Shad more than 100 m away, before
   they could sense higher water velocities near the powerhouse intakes.
   These results indicate that the combination of high-SPL pulsed
   ultrasounds (125 kHz) and the concurrent opening of adjacent spillway
   gates could guide postspawn American Shad away from powerhouse intakes.}},

Abstract = {{This study employs 29 provincial-level administrative regions in China

   values of the two indices of installed capacity and CO2 emission
   reduction, we are able to analyze the differences between installed

Abstract = {{The land surface and the atmospheric boundary layer are closely
   intertwined with respect to the exchange of water, trace gases, and
   energy. Nonlinear feedback and scale-dependent mechanisms are obvious by
   observations and theories. Modeling instead is often narrowed to single
   compartments of the terrestrial system or bound to traditional
   viewpoints of definite scientific disciplines. Coupled terrestrial
   hydrometeorological modeling systems attempt to overcome these
   limitations to achieve a better integration of the processes relevant
   for regional climate studies and local-area weather prediction. This
   study examines the ability of the hydrologically enhanced version of the
   Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-Hydro) to reproduce the
   regional water cycle by means of a two-way coupled approach and assesses
   the impact of hydrological coupling with respect to a traditional
   regional atmospheric model setting. It includes the observation-based
   calibration of the hydrological model component (offline WRF-Hydro) and
   a comparison of the classic WRF and the fully coupled WRF-Hydro models
   both with identically calibrated parameter settings for the land surface
   model (Noah-Multiparametrization; Noah-MP). The simulations are
   evaluated based on extensive observations at the Terrestrial
   Environmental Observatories ( I'LRENO) Pre-Alpine Observatory for the
   Ammer (600 km(2)) and Rott (55 km(2)) river catchments in southern
   Germany, covering a 5-month period (June-October 2016). The sensitivity
   of seven land surface parameters is tested using the
   Latin-Hypercube-One-factor-At-a-Time (LH-OAT) method, and six sensitive
   parameters are subsequently op- timized for six different subcatchments,
   using the model-independent Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty
   Analysis software (PEST). The calibration of the offline WRF-Hydro gives
   Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies between 0.56 and 0.64 and volumetric
   efficiencies between 0.46 and 0.81 for the six subcatchments. The
   comparison of the classic WRF and fully coupled WRF-Hydro models, both
   using the calibrated parameters from the offline model, shows only tiny
   alterations for radiation and precipitation but considerable changes for
   moisture and heat fluxes. By comparison with TERENO Pre-Alpine
   Observatory measurements, the fully coupled model slightly outperforms
   the classic WRF model with respect to evapotranspiration, sensible and
   ground heat flux, the near-surface mixing ratio, temperature, and
   boundary layer profiles of air temperature. The subcatchment-based water
   budgets show uniformly directed variations for evapotranspiration,
   infiltration excess and percolation, whereas soil moisture and
   precipitation change randomly.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{As three resources that are necessary for human survival and production,
   water, energy and food are increasingly closely linked. In recent years,
   the water-energy-food nexus has attracted special attention from
   international organizations and academic circles. However, due to the
   lack of research on its internal mechanisms, there is still controversy
   on whether the water-energy-food nexus can be used as a new policy
   basis. The internal mechanisms of the water-energy-food nexus were
   analysed from the perspective of industrial linkages in this paper and
   empirically verified by constructing an SVAR (structural vector auto
   regression) model using China's data. The results showed that there were
   two forms of conduction in China's water-energy-food nexus: the
   water-energy-food nexus with nuclear power participation and that with
   natural gas participation. The characteristics of China's
   water-energy-food nexus were derived. For the interactions of the
   water-energy segment in China's water-energy-food nexus, the conduction
   from energy to water was consistent for different types of energy, while
   that from water to energy varied depending on the type of energy. Food
   production always had a negative impact on energy production, while the
   conduction from energy to food varied for different types of energy. The
   conduction between food and the water supply was not as significant as
   was generally considered. Especially, the impact of the water supply on
   food production was weak. The order of strength intensity and the
   duration were also available for reference. Accordingly, a new policy
   basis was presented under the framework of China's water-energy-food
   nexus. Both our research design and research findings are significant in
   contributing to understanding the internal mechanisms of the
   water-energy-food nexus, and the policy implications are also helpful
   for achieving better policy effects. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{The Food-Energy-Water (FEW) nexus for urban sustainability needs to be
   analyzed via an integrative rather than a sectoral or silo approach,
   reflecting the ongoing transition from separate infrastructure systems
   to an integrated social-ecological-infrastructure system. As technology
   hubs can provide food, energy, water resources via decentralized and/or
   centralized facilities, there is an acute need to optimize FEW
   infrastructures by considering cost-benefit-risk tradeoffs with respect
   to multiple sustainability indicators. This paper identifies,
   categorizes, and analyzes global trends with respect to contemporary FEW
   technology metrics that highlights the possible optimal integration of a
   broad spectrum of technology hubs for possible cost-benefit-risk
   tradeoffs. The challenges related to multiscale and multiagent modeling
   processes for the simulation of urban FEW systems were discussed with
   respect to the aspects of scaling-up, optimization process, and risk
   assessment. Our review reveals that this field is growing at a rapid
   pace and the previous selection of analytical methodologies, nexus
   criteria, and sustainability indicators largely depended on individual
   FEW nexus conditions disparately, and full-scale cost-benefit-risk
   tradeoffs were very rare. Therefore, the potential full-scale technology
   integration in three ongoing cases of urban FEW systems in Miami (the
   United States), Marseille (France), and Amsterdam (the Netherlands) were
   demonstrated in due purpose finally.}},

Title = {{A Reservoir Operation Policy Using Inter-Basin Water Transfer for
   Maximizing Hydroelectric Benefits in Brazil}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The Hydrothermal Coordination problem consists of determining an
   operation policy for hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants within a
   given planning horizon. In systems with a predominance of hydraulic
   generation, the operation policy to be adopted should specify the
   operation of hydroelectric plants, so that hydroelectric resources are
   used economically and reliably. This work proposes the implementation of
   reservoir operation rules, using inter-basin water transfer through an
   optimization model based on Network Flow and Particle Swarm Optimization
   (PSO). The proposed algorithm aims to obtain an optimized operation
   policy of power generation reservoirs and consequently to maximize the
   hydroelectric benefits of the hydrothermal generation system, to reduce
   the use of thermoelectric plants, the importation and/or energy deficit
   and to reduce the cost associated with meeting the demand and reduce CO2
   emissions from combustion of fossil fuels used by thermoelectric plants.
   In order to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed
   approach, it was evaluated by optimizing two case studies using a system
   with four hydroelectric plants. The first case study does not consider
   transfer and water and the second case study uses water transfer between
   rivers. The obtained results illustrate that the proposed model allowed
   to maximize the hydroelectric resources of a hydrothermal generation
   system with economy and reliability.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a comprehensive research framework coupled with electric
   power demand forecasting, a regional electric system planning model, and
   post-optimization analysis is proposed for electric power system
   management. For dealing with multiple forms of uncertainties and
   dynamics concerning energy utilization, capacity expansions, and
   environmental protection, the inexact two-stage stochastic robust
   programming optimization model was developed. The novel programming
   method, which integrates interval parameter programming (IPP),
   stochastic robust optimization (SRO), and two-stage stochastic
   programming (TSP), was applied to electric power system planning and
   management in Harbin, China. Furthermore, the Gray-Markov approach was
   employed for effective electricity consumption prediction, and the
   forecasted results can be described as interval values with
   corresponding occurrence probability, aiming to produce viable input
   parameters of the optimization model. Ten scenarios were analyzed with
   different emissions reduction levels and electricity power structure
   adjustment modes, and the technique for order of preference by
   similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was selected to identify the most
   influential factors of planning decisions by selecting the optimal
   scheme. The results indicate that a diversified power structure that
   dominates by thermal power and is mainly supplemented by biomass power
   should be formed to ensure regional sustainable development and
   electricity power supply security in Harbin. In addition, power
   structure adjustment is more effective than the pollutants emission
   control for electricity power system management. The results are
   insightful for supporting supply-side energy reform, generating an
   electricity generation scheme, adjusting energy structures, and
   formulating energy consumption of local policies.}},

   operation of cascade hydropower reservoirs in China: Insights from
   system modeling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{254}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{As one of the most important international rivers in Asia, the Mekong
   River is famous for its abundant water and hydropower resources,
   fascinating biodiversity, and geopolitical importance. However, the
   rapid hydropower development in the Mekong River Basin has induced
   ecological risks and triggered water conflicts among six riparian
   nations. Balancing the competing interests of water, energy and
   ecosystems in the Mekong River Basin is a great challenge for riparian
   nations and is of global concern. This study quantitatively investigates
   what role the operation of the cascade reservoirs in China may play in
   mitigating existing conflicts and achieving cobenefits in the entire
   Mekong River Basin. An integrated modeling approach is adopted, and
   simulation-optimization analyses are performed to explore the tradeoff
   and/or synergy effects among the competing interests under varying
   reservoir operation strategies. The study reveals the disparate
   interactions among water, energy and ecosystem sectors and identifies
   the transboundary cobenefits of hydropower production and water supply.
   The major study findings are as follows. First, hydropower development
   in the upper Mekong River (also known as the Lancang River) can be
   beneficial for downstream agricultural water supply in certain
   circumstances if the cascade reservoirs in China are operated wisely.
   Second, the natural flow index adequately reflects ecological concerns
   in general, but additional objectives need to be included in the
   optimization if specific interests (e.g., phosphorous export from the
   Lancang River) are prioritized. Third, the tradeoffs between the
   agricultural water supply and ecosystem conservation, the two critical
   concerns of downstream countries, are intrinsic in the lower Mekong
   River Basin and are not induced by hydropower production in China.
   Fourth, the agricultural water supply in the downstream countries calls
   for a larger shift in the flow regime than hydropower production in
   China. Overall, the results of this study provide new insights into
   holistic management and effective transboundary cooperation in the
   Mekong River Basin, as well as in other international river basins with
   similar water-energy-ecosystem nexuses. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

   electricity potential, sawmills were contacted and the amount and type
   of generated residues assessed. The LHV (lower heating value) of wood of

   Data from real biomass power plants was fitted to calculate efficiencies
   versus power. With LHV data and conversion efficiency, the potential of
   installing micro to large-scale biomass-fired power plants was

   404 x 10(3) t of wood residues, showing that in the region there is a
   large untapped potential for energy valorization. If the residues were

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{261}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Owing to uneven development and unbalanced resource endowments within
   China, ensuring reliable energy, water and food supply is a core
   challenge to regional socio-economic development. This study makes a
   first attempt to examine and compare demand-driven energy, water and
   arable land (E-W-L) resource outsourcings within China based on the
   latest multi-regional input-output model. Results show that
   interprovincial trade reallocated 73.4\%, 33.9\% and 38.1\% of the
   national total E-W-L resource inputs in 2012, respectively. Investment
   was the dominant final demand category for driving energy requirements,
   while consumption was the leading final demand category for water and
   arable land requirements. Important provincial regions and critical
   transmission sectors for the trade of embodied E-W-L resources are
   identified. Substantial E-W-L resources were transferred from the
   central and western regions to the eastern regions. Especially, Inner
   Mongolia was the top interregional net exporter of embodied energy,
   while Jiangsu topped the net importer list. Regarding virtual water
   transfer, Xinjiang and Shandong were the biggest interregional net
   exporters and net importers, respectively, while Heilongjiang and
   Guangdong stood out in the net trade of embodied arable land. Owing to
   the impact of interprovincial trade, the resource occupancy levels of
   the eastern developed area were much higher than those of the
   northeastern, central and western areas. The imbalances in the levels of
   socio-economic development amongst provincial regions are mirrored by
   their patterns of E-W-L uses and related trade transfer. Understanding
   the synchronal outsourcings of E-W-L resource requirements provides
   important implications for targeted resource management in Chinese
   interprovincial supply chains.}},

Journal = {{FISHERIES RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The capture of ornamental fish is an important economic activity in
   Brazil. Most (79 \%) of the live aquarium fish exported from this
   country are captured in the Amazon region, in particular in the basins
   of the Negro, Xingu, and Tapajos rivers. The capture of ornamental fish
   in the Xingu basin is now under threat from the impacts caused by the
   construction of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam, which has resulted in
   habitat loss and changes in the river's hydrological cycle. An economic
   assessment of this fishery is needed to determine the magnitude of the
   possible impacts for the fishers over the long term. The present study
   estimated the costs and profitability of the fisheries that target
   ornamental species prior to the impoundment of the river, based on the
   records of the catches and economic income of 36 vessels. The results
   were positive, indicating that this activity was economically viable at
   that time. The harvesting of ornamental fish requires a mean initial
   investment of US\$ 2,640.14, with a net profitability of 28.63 \% for
   wooden canoes and 18.47 \% for aluminum boats, providing the fishers
   with a net income of US\$16.80 per fishing day. However, this income is
   extremely unstable due to the fluctuations in the capturability of the
   target species over the course of the year, and unpredictable
   oscillations in the demand for the most commercially valuable species.
   The predicted changes in the hydrological systems following the
   construction of the dam will likely result in a decrease in the economic
   yield of the fishery. Studies of this type are fundamentally important
   for the establishment of effective public policies for the fishery
   sector, and the mediation of socio-environmental impacts in the Amazon

Abstract = {{Steel production is not only a primary contributor to energy consumption

Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{More than half of the energy consumed for urban water utilities is for
   the water supply system (including water distribution and secondary
   water supply systems). Urban form (defined as city shapes and population
   distribution) is found to have significant impacts on energy used by the
   water supply system. This study aimed to explore the integrated impacts
   of urban forms on energy consumption for water supply by employing
   empirical analysis methods and virtual city modeling. In total, three
   types of city shapes (i.e. radial, grid and satellite) and three types
   of population distributions (i.e. uniform, monocentric and polycentric)
   were identified. The results reveal that population distribution has
   more significant impacts on the energy for water distribution and
   secondary water supply than city shapes. Energy consumed by secondary
   water supply accounts for more than 80\% of total energy consumption. It
   is found that radial-uniform cities consume the least energy for water
   supply (up to 89\% lower). The findings of this study shed light on
   enhancing overall sustainability in the urban water supply system. For
   future urban planning and governance, radial/monocentric urban form is
   encouraged when secondary water supply is not widely applied or needed,
   radial/uniform urban form is recommended when secondary water supply is
   required, and the entirely pressurized pumping system is suggested for
   secondary water supply in order to reduce energy use. (C) 2020 Elsevier

   pump water heater (ASHP-WH). Experimental studies were carried out from
   March 22, 2014 to April 21, 2014, which covered spring-summer transition
   seasons of these particular areas. The parameter it was proposed and a
   reference eta(base) of 2.4 was defined to rate the performance of these
   three systems. The results showed nearly 80\% of working conditions of
   the SA-WH had a eta which was higher than 2.4, wherein 70\% were above
   3. Furthermore, this study presents a regression model verified by
   measured data to predict the potential performance of the SA-WH in
   renewable energy shortage regions. This prediction model provides an
   optimal method of fully applying solar energy for the domestic hot water
   (DHW) and even heating by targeting better system performance. Then,
   three solar energy shortage cites of China were used as cases to
   illustrate the use of the prediction model. To meet the DHW demand in
   transitional seasons of these regions, the air-source heat pump of the
   SA-WH is suggested to be switched on 1 h before using when the average
   ambient temperature is below 20 degrees C; and be switched on at the
   hour with the highest temperature of the day when the average ambient
   temperature is above 20 degrees C and operate 1 h. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Extensive areas of agricultural land have been abandoned to ecological
   restoration in recent years in the karst region of Southwest China,
   which contributes to the greening of the area. However, there has yet no
   direct observation of carbon, water, and energy fluxes on abandoned land
   in the region. In addition, because of the coupling between above and
   below-ground processes, monitoring of the karst ecosystem needs to be
   conducted from a critical zone perspective. In this study, an integrated
   vertical observation system through air-vegetation-soil-cave continuums
   was constructed on abandoned farmland under natural restoration in
   Puding Karst Ecosystem Research Station. Preliminary results show that:
   First, vegetation cover restored rapidly after abandonment, and the
   measured net ecosystem exchange (NEE), soil CO2 efflux, actual
   evapotranspiration (ETa) and latent heat (LE) in the rainy season are
   about twice of that in the dry season, this strong seasonal variation
   relates to the typical subtropical monsoon climate with synchronous
   water and heat availability during rainy season. Second, high CO2
   concentrations and significant CO2 variation in the monitored cave
   indicate that the exchange of underground carbon pools with the
   atmosphere cannot be neglected in the carbon budget of the study site.}},

   following conclusions: First, inter-regional transmission and

   productive efficiency of the power system. Second, the separation of
   distribution from transmission has a positive impact on productive
   efficiency, and the effects of the unbundling reform on the power system
   differ significantly among divisions. Third, the introduction of an
   incomplete electricity trading market has a negative impact on the
   dynamic productive efficiency of the power system compared with the
   scenario without market reform, while complete market-oriented reform
   can improve dynamic productive efficiency and narrow the gap between

Abstract = {{This paper develops an interval multi-stage robust programming model for

   of robust programming, the optimal solutions could provide tradeoff
   information between system cost and decision maker's risk preference.
   The hybrid programming method is tailored for a case study of Shandong
   Province, China to validate its applicability and provide useful
   managerial insights, where energy-water interactions are gain great
   concerns. The model helps to make robust strategies associated with risk
   control for capacity expansion, carbon capture and storage (CCS)

   water allocation for electricity generation, with the goal of minimizing
   total cost. Besides, considering the variation of water resource
   conditions and environmental policies under climate change, the impacts
   of water resource availability and carbon emission caps on regional
   electric power system planning are explored and discussed. It is found
   that stricter carbon emission cap policy would facilitate the investment
   on CCS devices but have little impact on the installed capacity

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Hydro power can provide a source of dispatchable low-carbon electricity
   and a storage solution in a climate-dependent energy mix with high
   shares of wind and solar production. Therefore, understanding the effect
   climate has on hydro power generation is critical to ensure a stable
   energy supply, particularly at a continental scale. Here, we introduce a
   framework using climate data to model hydro power generation at the
   country level based on a machine learning method, the random forest
   model, to produce a publicly accessible hydro power dataset from 1979 to
   present for twelve European countries. In addition to producing a
   consistent European hydro power generation dataset covering the past 40
   years, the specific novelty of this approach is to focus on the lagged
   effect of climate variability on hydro power. Specifically, multiple
   lagged values of temperature and precipitation are used. Overall, the
   model shows promising results, with the correlation values ranging
   between 0.85 and 0.98 for run-of-river and between 0.73 and 0.90 for
   reservoir-based generation. Compared to the more standard optimal lag
   approach the normalised mean absolute error reduces by an average of
   10.23\% and 5.99\%, respectively. The model was also implemented over
   six Italian bidding zones to also test its skill at the sub-country
   scale. The model performance is only slightly degraded at the bidding
   zone level, but this also depends on the actual installed capacity, with
   higher capacities displaying higher performance. The framework and
   results presented could provide a useful reference for applications such
   as pan-European (continental) hydro power planning and for system
   adequacy and extreme events assessments.}},

   potential of using these global datasets in data-sparse regions. The
   fidelity of discharge simulation is the greatest when using observations

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},

Volume = {{139}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{As India implements its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), via
   an ambitious renewable energy target of 175 GW of renewable energy by
   2022, it is faced with an opportunity to further reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions. This opportunity is provided by the average cost of solar
   (and wind) energy falling below the variable cost of generating power
   from many existing coal plants. This indicates that, while other
   potential uses exist (e.g., making coal plants flexible), such expensive
   brownfield coal plants could potentially be economically retired today
   by simply switching to buying power from new solar plants. For example,
   by switching to a solar plant from a sample 5-year coal plant, the
   savings can be 33.90\% in net present value terms. Further, while the
   savings on energy procurement is obvious, there could also be savings on
   committed contractual obligations on paying fixed costs, via a process
   called securitization. For example, using cashflow analysis, we show
   that retiring a sample 5-year old coal plant can save an additional
   31.57\% in value. We also discuss plausible regulatory changes, for
   which there are precedents in India and elsewhere, that would enable
   this cost-effective transition to a deeper penetration of renewable
   energy via retirement of expensive coal plants.}},

Abstract = {{The security of food-energy-water (FEW) systems is an issue of global
   concern, especially in mega-urban regions (MURs) with high-density
   populations, industries and carbon emissions. To better understand the
   hidden links between urbanization and FEW systems, the pressure on FEW
   systems was quantified in a typical rapidly urbanizing region-the Bohai
   MUR. The correlations between urbanization indicators and the pressure
   on FEW systems were analyzed and the mechanism of the impact of
   urbanization on FEW systems was further investigated. The results showed
   that approximately 23\% of cropland was lost, 61\% of which was lost via
   conversion to construction land and urban areas expanded by 132.2\% in
   the Bohai MUR during 1980-2015. The pressure on FEW systems showed an
   upward trend, with the stress index of the pressure on FEW systems
   (FEW\_SI) ranging from 80.49\% to 134.82\%. The dominant pressure
   consisting of that has converted from water system pressure to energy
   system pressure since 2004. The FEW\_SI in the Bohai MUR was enhanced
   with cropland loss and increases in urbanization indicators.
   Additionally, land use, populations, incomes, policies and innovation
   are the main ways that urbanization affects FEW systems in MURs. This
   study enhances our understanding of the variation in pressure on FEW
   systems in MURs and the effects of urbanization on FEW systems, which
   will help stakeholders to enhance the resilience of FEW systems and

Abstract = {{China's rapid industrialization has induced water and energy shortage
   issue. Since water and energy resources are inextricably connected, the
   synergetic conservation of these two resources is conducive to China's
   sustainable development. In this paper, using a heterogeneous stochastic
   frontier model, we estimate the output and substitution elasticities of
   water and energy in China's industrial sector at the provincial level
   during the period of 2004-2014, in order to explore how to achieve
   synergetic conservation of water and energy resources by identifying the
   water-energy nexus. The results show that in China's industrial sector,
   the overall technical efficiency measured by the ratio of actual output
   to the ideal output in production frontier experienced a slight decline
   during the research period. The output elasticity (i.e., the changes in
   output caused by per unit change in a certain input) of water remains
   positive, while that of energy is negative in most years, indicating
   that water input increase contributes to industrial output growth,
   rather than energy input. Water and energy show a complementary
   relationship in most years, suggesting that a decrease in water input
   can reduce energy input. Therefore, to achieve the synergetic
   conservation of water and energy, the government should actively advance
   water-saving and energy-saving technologies by taking account of the
   differentiated production characteristics of different provincial-level
   industrial sector. In particular, when water and energy are
   complementary, the technological progress for saving either energy or

Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{To find a sustainable way of supplying food, energy, and water (FEW)
   while simultaneously protecting the ecosystem services, it is imperative
   to build greater understanding on interconnections, feedback, and
   dependencies in FEW systems. The FEW nexus has developed as a field of
   study to provide frameworks for such pursuits. Building upon previous
   work in this paper, we analyze FEW resources through the development of
   a virtual water trade network using the US network of food and energy
   flows and their associated virtual water contents. Our main objective is
   to provide a quantitative estimation of the virtual water embodied in
   the internal US food and energy transfers and analyze the associated
   interdependencies of these connections. Three methodological
   advancements demonstrate the novelty of this work. First, unlike
   existing FEW virtual water modeling studies, our work separates corn
   into both food and energy resources accounting for the significant use
   of corn for ethanol in the United States. Second, we apply recently
   published water consumption values for energy commodities confirming the
   variation between previous water footprint studies and these more
   accurate accounting procedures. Third, we examine network properties of
   the trade flows furthering FEW nexus literature and showcasing avenues
   for future research. Our results indicate that accounting for the
   transfer of corn from the food commodity network to the energy commodity
   network leads to a virtual water footprint decline of 11\% for the
   cereal grain virtual water network. Additionally, the food trade network

   footprints between water scarce and water abundant states differ
   substantially between food and energy virtual water networks. A
   quantifiable understanding of the water footprint network embodied in
   the food and energy trade can help in developing policies for promoting
   conservation and efficiency in the context of the FEW nexus. (C) 2019

Title = {{An agent-based spatiotemporal integrated approach to simulating in-home
   water and related energy use behaviour: A test case of Beijing, China}},

Abstract = {{Water and energy consumptions in the residential sector are highly
   correlated. A better understanding of the correlation would help save
   both water and energy, for example, through technological innovations,
   management and policies. Recently, there is an increasing need for a
   higher spatiotemporal resolution in the analysis and modelling of
   water-energy demand, as the results would be more useful for policy
   analysis and infrastructure planning in both water and energy systems.
   In response, this paper developed an agent-based spatiotemporal
   integrated approach to simulate the water-energy consumption of each
   household or person agent in second throughout a whole day, considering
   the influences of out-ofhome activities (e.g., work and shopping) on
   in-home activities (e.g., bathing, cooking and cleaning). The integrated
   approach was tested in the capital of China, Beijing. The temporal
   results suggested that the 24-hour distributions of water and related
   energy consumptions were quite similar, and the waterenergy consumptions
   were highly correlated (with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.89);
   The spatial results suggested that people living in the central
   districts and the central areas of the outer districts tended to consume
   more water and related energy, and also the water-energy correlation
   varies across space. Such spatially and temporally explicit results are
   expected to be useful for policy making (e.g., time-of-use tariffs) and
   infrastructure planning and optimization in both water and energy
   sectors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water stored in the form of snow and glaciers in the High Mountain Asia
   (HMA) region regulates the water supply, and resultant water-based
   economies, that support the livelihoods of millions of people. Trends in
   the seasonal and long-term melting of snow and glaciers, governed by
   initial ice reserves, meteorological factors and geographic features,
   vary across sub-basins in the HMA region. We examined the economic
   impacts of climate-led changes in river flow in two drainage basins, one
   each from the Karakoram and Central Himalaya region. We used an
   integrated assessment framework to estimate the changes in economic
   value of the hydropower generation from hydropower plants on rivers fed
   by snow and glacier melt in the two sub-basins. The framework, developed
   under a NASA High Mountain Asia project, coupled biophysical models (a
   suite of climate models, snow/glacier-hydrology, and hydropower model)
   with economic analysis. We compared the differences in estimated river
   flow over historic and future time using the water balance model in
   sixteen scenarios (eight climate models and two emissions scenarios) for
   rivers upstream of hydropower plants in each sub-basin. Using the
   hydropower model we developed, we estimated the changes in hydropower
   generation at the Naltar IV hydropower plant, with an 18 MW capacity,
   located in Hunza, Karakoram, and the Trishuli hydropower plant, with a
   19.6 MW capacity, in Trishuli, Central Himalaya. When compared to their
   baselines, the estimated impact of climate change and temporal
   variability were higher for the Naltar plant than for the Trishuli
   plant. Our sensitivity analysis shows that hydropower plants with water
   storage facilities help reduce the impact of changes, but the estimated
   impacts are higher for the higher capacity plants. This study provides
   an example of the differential impacts of climate change on hydropower
   plants located in rivers fed by varying amounts of snow and glacier melt
   at different decades in this century. This type of integrated assessment
   of climate change impact will support the scientific understanding of
   hydrologic flow and its impacts on a hydropower economy under various
   climate scenarios, as well as generate information about water resource
   management in a changing climate.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Volume = {{249}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{Food, energy and water are critical resources for human well-being. A
   prerequisite for achieving the sustainable utilization of these
   resources is how to identify and manage the synergies and trade-offs
   within the food-energy-water (FEW) nexus. This study considered multiple
   combinations of dimensions, including economic benefits, social benefits
   and negative environmental impacts, to assess the performance of China's
   FEW nexus system. The efficiency of the FEW nexus from 2005 to 2017 was
   evaluated in 30 provinces across China using a multiplicative
   environmental data envelopment analysis (ME-DEA) model. The coupling
   interaction among the FEW nexus was investigated from the perspectives
   of the coupling degree and coupling coordination degree. Finally, five
   efficiency bundles of the FEW nexus were identified using the K-means
   clustering method. Our results showed that 78\% of the provinces with
   high- and sub-high efficiency were distributed in eastern and central
   China. Conversely, 86\% of the low-efficiency provinces were
   concentrated in western China. Additionally, the coupling coordination
   degree of most provinces (63\%) generally decreased from 2005 to 2017.
   These results revealed irreconcilable trade-offs among the subsystems of
   the FEW nexus. Some valuable suggestions for the sustainable use of
   resources were proposed according to the characteristics of the five
   efficiency classes. Class 1 performed well in the water, food and labor
   dimensions. To balance the FEW nexus, we recommend adjusting
   energy-related policies. Class 2 showed inefficiency in all dimensions,
   particularly for labor and social efficiencies. Therefore, the
   government should provide more employment opportunities and improve
   social benefits for households. A gap in economic efficiency was found
   in Class 3. Thus, policies and funding support for the economic
   dimension are recommended. Class 4 had lower efficiency values than the
   average, particularly in terms of energy and environmental aspects. The
   government should pay more attention to pollution treatment. For Class
   5, synergies were found in all partial efficiencies; thus, the current
   development strategies should be adhered. These findings are helpful for
   developing policies that enhance the sustainability of the FEW nexus.

Abstract = {{Energy, CO2 emissions and water (ECW) are fundamentally linked, holistic

   2002 to 2015 and adopts four indicators, i.e., sectoral embodied ECW,
   the proportion of direct ECW in embodied ECW and their changes to
   explore sectoral ECW nexus characteristics of China. Power (EGW) and
   transport (TRS) are key ECW nexus sectors in China with much larger
   embodied ECW and direct ECW. Sectors agriculture (AGR), mining (MIN),
   and construction (CON) show great changes in their ECW nexus
   characteristics between 2002 and 2015. Sector AGR is gradually becoming
   ECW-intensive because agricultural modernization with the large-scale
   adoption of modern water-saving irrigation technologies leads to rapid
   increase in its energy and water use. Differentiated ECW-related

   identifying their different ECW nexus characteristics, as well as

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},

Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Four large hydropower stations are located along the Jinsha River, in an
   area that has the highest frequency of large damaging debris flows in
   China. The total power generation capacity of the dams is > 42 million
   kilowatts. Through field investigation, laboratory analysis, model
   calculation, and statistical analysis, we studied the debris flows
   occurring in the gullies near the Baihetan hydropower station to
   determine the characteristics of their dynamic parameters and the
   effectiveness of existing debris flow control measures. The dynamic
   parameters of debris flows vary significantly because of the different
   characteristics of the fluvial basins and their longitudinal slope
   gradients. Evaluation results showed that the existing debris flow
   control measures in the Aizi and Dazhai gullies should be able to
   withstand events with 100-year recurrence period. The debris flow risk
   in these gullies is therefore low in the present situation. It is
   important to note that these control measures would also be adequate for
   events with 500-year recurrence period; therefore, the debris flow risk
   would remain low in the theoretical future situations. We propose an
   evaluation method of the effectiveness of debris flow engineering
   control based on an analysis of the engineering measurements'
   effectiveness. The research results can be implemented to improve the
   design of the Baihetan hydropower station. More importantly, the results
   can be applied for the development of evaluation methods of the

Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The Xiluodu Dam is a concrete double-curvature arch dam with a crest
   elevation of 610 m and a height of 285.5 m. Since the impoundment of the
   Xiluodu reservoir, remarkable river valley contractions (RVCs) have been
   observed upstream and downstream of the reservoir, potentially
   threatening the safety of the dam. However, the cause of these RVCs
   remains unclear. Based on an analysis of hydrogeological conditions, the
   RVCs were determined a result of the expansion of the aquifer, within
   which the effective stress decreased due to an increase in the hydraulic
   head after reservoir impoundment. Referring to the hydrostatic seasonal
   time (HST) model, a groundwater hydrostatic seasonal (GHS) model is
   proposed for simulating and predicting the development of the RVCs.
   Unlike the HST model, the GHS model can provide information on aquifer
   hydraulic diffusivity. The calibration results illustrate that the GHS
   model can accurately fit the observed RVCs data. The calculation results
   revealed that the RVCs were mainly affected by the hydraulic head of the
   confined aquifer, and that seasonal effects gave rise to less than 10\%
   of the total RVCs. Finally, the development of RVCs were predicted using
   the GHS model. The prediction results demonstrated that the RVCs of most
   monitoring lines in the Xiluodu reservoir would gradually approach a
   convergence condition after 6 February 2021. Until the deadline of the
   prediction on 1 May 2035, there is still one monitoring line that has
   not reached a convergence condition (whose RVCs are 157.6 mm, and where
   the RVC growth rate will decrease to 0.005 mm/d by that time).
   Considering the large amount of RVCs, we think the safety of the dam
   requires closer consideration.}},

   environmental issues. Water, energy, and carbon play significant roles
   in regional sustainable development. It is critical to understand the
   Water-Energy-Carbon Emissions nexus, and this study explores the nexus
   using the Environmental Input-Output model. The embodied water and
   energy consumption and embodied carbon emissions are assessed. The water
   and energy consumption coefficients and CO2 emission coefficients are
   analysed. The main results are: (1) The Water-Energy-Carbon Emissions
   nexus characteristics of light industry, heavy industry, and service
   industry were similar: water-intensive, energy-intensive, and
   carbon-emission-intensive; (2) Agriculture consumed 64.38\% of the
   national water supply; however, the water utilisation efficiency was
   only 32\%; (3) Agriculture had much higher water consumption and direct
   water consumption coefficients. Light industry, service industry, and
   heavy industry were the top three sectors in terms of indirect water
   consumption coefficients; (4) Heavy industry, light industry, and
   service industry were the top three sectors with the highest indirect
   energy consumption coefficients and carbon emission coefficients. The
   consumption (water and energy) and CO2 emission coefficients can provide
   significant support for sustainable development strategies. This study
   provides a better understanding of the Water-Energy-Carbon Emissions
   nexus in China.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a general design method for strengthening regional

   source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC)
   technology. First, three main security and stability problems of

   strengthen a real high-proportion renewable energy regional power grid

   VSC stations. Third, three evaluation indexes that related to the
   security and stability of power grids are put forward, namely line load
   rate, bus voltage level and system strength of the VSC-connected
   terminal. Finally, the two alternative reinforcement schemes are
   analyzed in detail. The results show that, the two VSC-HVDC schemes can
   well solve the line overload problem of electromagnetic loop networks

   the voltage level of the system during the fault period. After a

Abstract = {{The NASA Energy and Water Cycle Study (NEWS) climatology is a
   self-consistent coupled annual and seasonal cycle solution for
   radiative, turbulent, and water fluxes over Earth's surface using Earth
   observation data covering 2000-09. Here we seek to improve the NEWS
   solution, particularly over the ocean basins, by considering spatial
   covariances in the observation errors (some evidence for which is found
   by comparing five turbulent flux products over the oceans) and by
   introducing additional horizontal transports from ocean reanalyses as
   weak constraints. By explicitly representing large error covariances
   between surface heat flux components over the major ocean basins we
   retain the flux contrasts present in the original data and infer
   additional heat losses over the North Atlantic Ocean, more consistent
   with a strong Atlantic overturning. This change does not alter the
   global flux balance but if only the errors in evaporation and
   precipitation are correlated then those fluxes experience larger
   adjustments (e.g., the surface latent heat flux increases to 85 +/- 2 W
   m(-2)). Replacing SeaFlux v1 with J-OFURO v3 (Japanese Ocean Flux Data
   Sets with Use of Remote Sensing Observations) ocean fluxes also leads to
   a considerable increase in the global latent heat loss as well as a
   larger North Atlantic heat loss. Furthermore, including a weak
   constraint on the horizontal transports of heat and freshwater from
   high-resolution ocean reanalyses improves the net fluxes over the North
   Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, and Arctic Ocean, without any impact on the
   global flux balances. These results suggest that better characterized
   flux uncertainties can greatly improve the quality of the optimized flux

Title = {{Optimizing hydropower dam location and removal in the Sao Francisco
   river basin, Brazil to balance hydropower and river biodiversity
   tradeoffs}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{To support eco-friendly hydropower planning in developing regions, we
   propose a spatial optimization model for locating dams to balance
   tradeoffs between hydropower generation and migratory fish species
   richness. Our model incorporates two special features. First, it is
   tailored to the dispersal of tropical migratory fishes, which typically
   require long, unimpeded river stretches to complete their life-cycle. To
   model fish with this type of dispersal pattern, we introduce the concept
   of a river pathway, which represents a novel way to describe river
   connectivity. Second, it combines decisions about dam placement and
   removal, thus facilitating opportunities for hydropower offsetting. We
   apply our model to the Sao Francisco River basin, Brazil, an area of
   hydropower-freshwater biodiversity conflict. We find that dams have
   reduced weighted migratory fish richness 51\% compared to a pre-dam
   baseline. We also find that even limited dam removal has the potential
   to significantly enhance fish biodiversity. Offsetting the removal of a
   single dam by the optimal siting of new dams could increase fish
   richness by 25\% above the current average. Moving forward, optimizing
   new dam sites to increase hydropower by 20\%, rather than selecting the
   fewest number of dams, could reduce fish species losses by 89\%. If
   decisions about locating new dams are combined with dam removal, then a
   win-win can even be achieved with 20\% greater hydropower and 19\%
   higher species richness. Regardless of hydropower targets and dam
   removal options, a key observation is that optimal sites for dams are
   mostly located in the upper reaches of the basin rather than along the
   main stem of the Sao Francisco River or its main tributaries.}},

Volume = {{247}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Water, Energy and Food (WEF) are key elements of economic and social
   sustainable development, and present a complex nexus. Existed WEF nexus
   research is mainly confined to qualitative analyses, and it needs
   constant improvement and increases quantitative analyses. In China,
   water security is the most prominent problem in the WEF-nexus, which is
   manifested in the competitive relationship between food and energy
   production for water. Therefore, the matter of alleviating water
   resources stress has become a difficult and hot issue. After improving
   the existed water footprint accounting method for food and energy
   production, this study calculated the food water footprints (blue water
   footprint and green water footprint) in the 31 provinces of mainland
   China in 2015, as well as the blue water footprints of major energy
   systems (coal, oil, natural gas and thermal power generation). This
   study proposed water resources pressure index (I-ws ), water resources
   pressure contribution rate of food and energy (WCR), water consumption
   rate of food and energy (n) and competition composite index (CCI) of
   WEF, which were used to evaluate the consumption of water resources in
   food and energy production in different regions, and assess the
   intensity of competition for water resources in food and energy
   production. The results showed that the national food water footprint in
   2015 was 690.8 Gm(3), and the blue food water footprint was 287.8 Gm(3).
   The main water-consuming blue energy water footprint was 18.5 Gm(3), and
   coal production accounted for 9.9\% and thermal power generation
   accounted for 87.6\%. According to the competition indicators, the
   competition relationship among the administrative regions of the 31
   provinces in mainland China was obtained. For example, 5 provinces had
   serious competition and 19 provinces had weak competition. The water
   consumption of the energy industry continues to grow rapidly by economic
   development. Corresponding measures should be taken according to the
   different competition levels for water resources. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Seasonal mismatches between electricity supply and demand is increasing
   due to expanded use of wind, solar and hydropower resources, which in
   turn raises the interest on low-cost seasonal energy storage options.
   Seasonal pumped hydropower storage (SPHS) can provide long-term energy
   storage at a relatively low-cost and co-benefits in the form of
   freshwater storage capacity. We present the first estimate of the global
   assessment of SPHS potential, using a novel plant-siting methodology
   based on high-resolution topographical and hydrological data. Here we
   show that SPHS costs vary from 0.007 to 0.2 US\$ m(-1) of water stored,
   1.8 to 50 US\$ MWh(-1) of energy stored and 370 to 600 US\$ kW(-1) of

   mountainous regions demonstrating significantly more potential. The
   estimated world energy storage capacity below a cost of 50 US\$ MWh(-1)
   is 17.3 PWh, approximately 79\% of the world electricity consumption in
   2017. The potential of seasonal pumped hydropower storage (SPHS) plant
   to fulfil future energy storage requirements is vast in mountainous

Abstract = {{As scientists seek to better understand the linkages between energy,
   water, and land systems, they confront a critical question of scale for
   their analysis. Many studies exploring this nexus restrict themselves to
   a small area in order to capture fine-scale processes, whereas other
   studies focus on interactions between energy, water, and land over
   broader domains but apply coarse resolution methods. Detailed studies of
   a narrow domain can be misleading if the policy intervention considered
   is broad-based and has impacts on energy, land, and agricultural
   markets. Regional studies with aggregate low-resolution representations
   may miss critical feedbacks driven by the dynamic interactions between
   subsystems. This study applies a novel, gridded energy-land-water
   modeling system to analyze the local environmental impacts of biomass
   cofiring of coal power plants across the upper MISO region. We use this
   framework to examine the impacts of a hypothetical biomass cofiring
   technology mandate of coal-fired power plants using corn residues. We
   find that this scenario has a significant impact on land allocation,
   fertilizer applications, and nitrogen leaching. The effects also impact
   regions not involved in cofiring through agricultural markets. Further,
   some MISO coal-fired plants would cease generation because the
   competition for biomass increases the cost of this feedstock and because
   the higher operating costs of cofiring renders them uncompetitive with
   other generation sources. These factors are not captured by analyses
   undertaken at the level of an individual power plant. We also show that
   a region-wide analysis of this cofiring mandate would have registered
   only a modest increase in nitrate leaching (just +5\% across the upper
   MISO region). Such aggregate analyses would have obscured the extremely
   large increases in leaching at particular locations, as much as +60\%.
   Many of these locations are already pollution hotspots. Fine-scale
   analysis, nested within a broader framework, is necessary to capture
   these critical environmental interactions within the energy, land, and
   water nexus.}},

Abstract = {{The combined heating and power (CHP) system with turbine-driving fans

   conducted to provide insights into improvement options. It is revealed
   that the boiler is the main source of exergy destruction, followed by
   the steam-water heat exchangers (SWHE), temperature and pressure reducer

   the system are 89.72\% and 10.07\%, while the boiler's are 84.89\% and

Abstract = {{Simultaneous generation of plasma by microwave irradiation of perovskite
   or the spinel type of silica supported porous catalyst oxides and their
   reduction by nitrogen in the presence of oxygen is demonstrated. As a
   result of plasma generation in air, NOx generation is accompanied by the
   development of highly heterogeneous regions in terms of chemical and
   morphological variations within the catalyst. Regions of almost
   completely reduced catalyst are dispersed within the catalyst oxide,
   across micron-scale domains. The quantification of the catalyst
   heterogeneity and evaluation of catalyst structure are studied using
   Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy and
   XRD. Plasma generating supported spinel catalysts are synthesized using
   the technique developed by the author (Catalysts; 2016; 6; 80) and
   BaTiO3 is used to exemplify perovskites. Silica supported catalyst
   systems are represented as M/Si = X (single catalysts) or as
   M((1))/M((2))/Si = X/Y/Z (binary catalysts) where M; M((1)) M((2)) = Cr;
   Mn; Fe; Co; Cu and X, Y, Z are the molar ratio of the catalysts and SiO2
   support. Composite porous catalysts are synthesized using a mixture of
   Co and BaTiO3. In all the catalysts, structural heterogeneity manifests
   itself through defects, phase separation and increased porosity
   resulting in the creation of the high activity sites. The chemical
   heterogeneity results in reduced and oxidized domains and in very large
   changes in catalyst/support ratio. High electrical potential activity
   within BaTiO3 particles is observed through the formation of electrical
   treeing. Plasma generation starts as soon as the supported catalyst is
   synthesized. Two conditions for plasma generation are observed:
   Metal/Silica molar ratio should be > 1/2 and the resulting oxide should
   be spinel type; represented as MaOb (a = 3; b = 4 for single catalyst).
   Composite catalysts are represented as \{M/Si = X\}/BaTiO3 and obtained
   from the catalyst/silica precursor fluid with BaTiO3 particles which
   undergo fragmentation during microwave irradiation. Further irradiation
   causes plasma generation, NOx formation and lattice oxygen depletion.
   Partially reduced spinels are represented as MaOb-c. These reactions
   occur through a chemical looping process in micron-scale domains on the
   porous catalyst surface. Therefore; it is possible to scale-up this
   process to obtain NOx from MaOb for nitric acid production and H-2
   generation from MaOb-c by catalyst re-oxidized by water. Re-oxidation by
   CO2 delivers CO as fuel. These findings explain the mechanism of
   conversion of combustion gases (CO2 + N-2) to CO and NOx via a chemical
   looping process. Mechanism of catalyst generation is proposed and the
   resulting structural inhomogeneity is characterized. Plasma generating
   catalysts also represent a new form of Radar Absorbing Material (RAM)
   for stealth and protection from radiation in which electromagnetic
   energy is dissipated by plasma generation and catalytic reactions. These

Abstract = {{Urban sustainability has been one of the most important issues in the
   last decades. The modification of watercourses and their integration to
   power production facilities have resulted in severe environmental
   impacts around the globe. This study presents a sustainability analysis
   to examine the current state of the Guandu river basin Brazil. The
   approach includes the development of a hydrological model to simulate
   the stream flow, and an evaluation of the impacts of potential scenarios
   projected for 2035. Future scenarios included climate and land use
   change, and water transfers from surrounding basins. The results show
   that future scenarios might distress the total volume of water naturally
   captured in the basin mainly because of significant changes in
   precipitation patterns. Such changes could reduce the amount of water
   and electricity supply in the region, as well as the sustainability of
   water resources. The proposed model can be used as a decision making
   support tool to search for sustainable strategies for water and

Abstract = {{A once-per-century geoelectric hazard map is created for the U.S.
   high-voltage power grid. A statistical extrapolation from 31 years of
   magnetic field measurements is made by identifying 84 geomagnetic storms
   with the Kp and Dst indices. Data from 24 geomagnetic observatories,
   1,079 magnetotelluric survey sites, and 17,258 transmission lines are
   utilized to perform a geoelectric hazard analysis with the most
   comprehensive data publicly available. With these data, we estimate
   once-per-century geoelectric fields at the magnetotelluric survey sites
   and calculate the theoretical voltages within transmission lines in the
   U.S. power grid. Once-per-century geoelectric field strengths span more
   than 3 orders of magnitude from a minimum of 0.02 V/km at a site in
   Idaho to a maximum of 27.2 V/km at a site in Maine, with nearly 30\% of
   the surveyed land area exceeding 1 V/km. We show the influence that
   geoelectric field polarization has on geoelectric hazards when viewed on
   a power transmission network. The calculated transmission line voltages
   can approach 1,000 V in some transmission lines. Four regions in the
   United States with particularly notable geoelectric hazards are
   identified and discussed: the East Coast, Pacific Northwest, Upper
   Midwest, and the Denver metropolitan area.}},

Title = {{The impact of the generation mix on the current regulatory framework for

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{137}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The impact of the generation mix on the two ongoing regulatory
   frameworks for hydropower remuneration in Brazil is analysed. In the
   first, Energy Allocation Mechanism (EAM), individual operational risks
   are mitigated by a risk-sharing principle within a hydro pool structure.
   The second, Insurance Call Option Obligation (ICO), is an insurance
   approach which enables the hydro generators to transfer their risks to
   the consumers. The frameworks are assessed for three long-term
   scenarios, with a varying share of non-hydro renewables and thermal
   sources in the generation mix, using a Stochastic Dual Dynamic
   Programming (SDDP) approach. The results indicate that the generation
   mix may considerably influence EAM performance and hydropower economic
   feasibility. An increase in base-load and peak-load thermal generation
   influences EAM performance negatively, while the penetration of RES does
   not yield significant impacts if its expansion is met by equivalent
   increment in load. The ICO approach drives significant transfer of
   wealth from consumers to generators, which can be addressed by adapting
   the insurance premium setting criteria, as presented in this study.
   Finally, ICO design may lead to an overall improvement in the market
   level welfare, when compared to the EAM, if a criterion of equivalence
   is set as a preferable design goal.}},

   Implication for impoundment impacts}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{257}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In order to investigate the impacts of dam-related water impoundment on
   the spatial-temporal variations and transport of anthropogenic organic
   pollutants, 15 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were
   analyzed in water samples from the Shuikou Reservoir (SKR) of the
   Minjiang River. The SKR was formed after the construction of the Shuikou
   Dam, which is the largest hydropower station in Southeast China. The
   water samples were collected from the backwater zone of the SKR, in both
   the wet and dry seasons, corresponding to the drainage and impoundment
   periods of water flow, respectively. The concentrations of the dissolved
   PAHs in surface water from the wet season (average of 161 +/- 97 ng L-1)
   were significantly higher (ANOVA, p < 0.01) than those from the dry
   season (average of 43 +/- 21 ng L-1). PAH concentrations in the SKR
   decreased from upstream (industrialized cities) to downstream (rural
   towns or counties), indicating high PAH loads caused by intensive
   urbanization effects. The high proportions of 3-ring PAHs in the wet
   season were from local sources via surface runoff; while the elevated
   proportions of 4- to 6- ring PAHs in the dry season reflected
   atmospheric deposition emerged of these PAHs and/or volatilization of
   3-ring PAHs enhanced. Molecular diagnostic ratios of PAH isomers in
   multimedium and principal component analysis indicated that PAH presence
   in the SKR was mainly attributed to pyrogenic origin. The isomeric
   ratios of fluoranthene to fluoranthene plus pyrene in the wet season
   were homogeneous, implying that there were continuous new inputs along
   the riverine runoff. However, these ratios showed spatial downward trend
   in the dry season, indicating continued degradation of PAHs occurred
   along the transport path during the impoundment period. The input and
   output fluxes of PAHs in the SKR were 5330 kg yr(-1) and 2991 kg yr(-1),
   revealing that the reservoir retained contaminants after impoundment of
   the hydropower dam. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminium is a widely used metal and one of the most energy intensive
   industries, and therefore it has been included in most energy models and

   in this study are; Market World (MW), Toward Resilience (TR), Security
   Foremost (SF), and Equitability World (EW). The results indicate that
   global CO2 emissions are expected to increase as a result of increasing
   aluminium demand, although aluminium secondary supply, energy
   efficiency, and cleaner energy supply technologies are expected to
   increase in the next 30 years. Policy and sustainability (TR and EW)
   scenarios are ultimately the best in terms of global climate change
   since the two scenarios have the lowest CO2 emissions, although they
   also have the highest aluminium demand and energy. It is therefore

Abstract = {{The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) Coordinated Development Strategy marks
   the beginning of China's endeavor to build a world-class Capital Circle.
   Facing a slew of challenges, the BTH Region has an urgent need for
   identifying a green, low-carbon and circular development path and
   building a clean, low-carbon, safe and efficient modern energy system.
   The Region's coal-dominated energy consumption style has brought about
   serious environmental and ecological impacts on itself. Vigorous efforts
   to develop renewable energy have resulted in an explosive growth of wind
   and solar power in the BTH region and huge integration challenges to the
   power networks as well. Sufficient operational flexibility is crucial
   for promoting the renewable penetration into the power system. However,
   there is still a lack of effective means to systematically evaluate the
   flexibility performance. In this paper, we conducted a firstof-kind
   in-depth renewable integration study for the BTH Region. First, we
   summarized the challenges of renewable power generation in the BTH
   region from the perspective of ``source-grid-load{''}. Second, we
   proposed a balanced renewable energy integration analytical framework,
   which can systematically evaluate the technical and economic performance
   of various flexible resources. Then we conducted a detailed evaluation
   of the technical and economic performance of main flexible resources
   with the analytical framework. Finally, we explored the medium- and
   long-term flexibility development pathways and proposed policy
   recommendations for the BTH Region to enhance the flexibility of power
   system and thereby promote the integration of renewable energy. Based on
   the proposed development pathways for improving the Region's flexibility
   of ``source-grid-load{''}, the BTH Region is expected to have a
   significant flexibility to support the accommodation of 125.93 GW of
   wind power and 44.30 GW of PV power by 2035. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Characteristics of Microseismicity during Breakthrough in Deep Tunnels:
   Case Study of Jinping-II Hydropower Station in China}},

Abstract = {{Rockbursts are a common form of disaster that occur during the
   construction of deep tunnels in hard rock. This is especially the case
   in the breakthrough stage of excavation, when even more attention should
   be paid to the risk of rockburst in order to ensure construction safety.
   This work studied the characteristics of the microseismicity associated
   with 10 breakthrough cases in the deep tunnels (maximal depth 2,525 m)
   of the Jinping-II Hydropower Station in China. The results showed that
   the microseismicity was relatively more active in the breakthrough
   period (compared with that in adjacent sections) due to the effect of
   working two faces in tandem and was concentrated in the breakthrough
   section. Furthermore, the characteristic c-value associated with the
   seismic energy-potency relationship was larger, indicating that the
   apparent stress was greater in the breakthrough section. Spatiotemporal
   changes in microseismicity that are associated with rockburst
   development were found in the breakthrough section which can be used to
   qualitatively warn of the risk of rockburst. Rockburst risk can be
   quantitatively assessed during tunnel breakthrough based on the
   monitored microseismicity and a quantitative method of rockburst
   warning. Based on results thus obtained, the rockburst risk in the
   breakthrough section was found to increase continuously as the distance
   between the two working faces decreased. When both working faces are
   excavated in the breakthrough section, the quantitative risk of
   rockburst increases significantly. However, when only one working face
   is in action, the quantitative risk of rockburst increases only
   slightly. The results of this work will be helpful in warning of
   impending rockbursts, and thus improving the safety of the construction
   process, when breakthrough is carried out in deep tunnels excavated in
   hard rock. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Volume = {{153}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{China, whose power system accounts for about 13\% of global
   energy-related CO2 emissions, has begun implementing market-based
   power-sector reforms. This paper simulates power system dispatch in
   China's Southern Grid region and examines the economic and environmental
   impacts of market-based operations. We find that market-based operation
   can increase efficiency and reduce costs in all Southern Grid
   provinces-reducing wholesale electricity costs by up to 35\% for the
   entire region relative to the 2016 baseline. About 60\% of the potential
   cost reduction can be realized by creating independent provincial
   markets within the region, and the rest by creating a regional market
   without transmission expansion. The wholesale market revenue is adequate
   to recover generator fixed costs; however, financial restructuring of
   current payment mechanisms may be necessary. Electricity markets could
   also reduce the Southern Grid's CO2 emissions by up to 10\% owing to
   more efficient thermal dispatch and avoided hydro/renewable curtailment.
   The benefits of regional electricity markets with expanded transmission
   likely will increase as China's renewable generation increases.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Industrial parks are main sites for industrial sectors and are critical
   clients for water and energy management. However, the water-energy nexus
   at the industrial park-level is still poorly understood. This study
   established high-resolution profiles of water use and energy consumption
   and their linkages in Chinese industrial parks for the first time. Based
   on this inventory, the water use and energy consumption of 209 Chinese
   national industrial parks were uncovered from a life-cycle perspective.
   The total water use of these parks accounted for 6\% of national
   industrial water use, while the total energy consumption accounted for
   10\% of national energy consumption. Surface water and coal played an
   undeniably dominant role in direct water and energy structures, with a
   share of 95\% and 74\%, respectively. The water-energy nexus was then
   analyzed, and we observed that the indirect water use embodied in the
   energy sector (29\% of the total water use) was much more significant
   than the indirect energy consumption induced by the water sector (nearly
   0\% of the total energy consumption). Moreover, water and energy were
   closely linked and positively correlated in industrial parks;
   energy-intensive parks generally tended to be water-intensive. Finally,
   water use and energy consumption in the parks toward 2020 and 2030 were
   targeted, according to cap and intensity controls highlighted in

Title = {{Bootstrap-based confidence interval estimation for thermal security
   region of bulk power grid}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Thermal security region (TSR) is a powerful tool for monitoring and
   controlling the thermal security of bulk power grid with high
   penetration of renewable energy. One of the major challenges of TSR in
   practical application is to obtain the exact analytical expression of
   the TSR boundary (TSRB) because TSRB is a nonlinear hypersurface
   described by an implicit function. For this reason, the TSRB is usually
   approximated by hyperplane instead of getting the exact analytical
   expression. Traditionally, the coefficients of the hyperplane are
   estimated with a set of original TSRB points using least square
   estimation (LSE). However, LSE is a point estimation method, which is
   incapable of evaluating the quality of the estimation. In addition, the
   accuracy and computational efficiency of the hyperplane approximation
   are influenced by the number of TSRB points significantly. In this
   paper, a bootstrap based confidence interval estimation is proposed to
   estimate not only the coefficients of TSRB approximation hyperplane, but
   also the standard deviations and confidence intervals of the
   coefficients for evaluating the quality and reliability of the
   approximation results. First, empirical distribution functions (EDFs) of
   the coefficients of TSRB approximation hyperplane are approximated from
   a set of original TSRB points by using residual resampling bootstrap
   method. Then, the EDFs of the coefficients are employed to estimate the
   coefficients of the approximation hyperplane. Meanwhile, the standard
   deviations and confidence intervals of the estimated coefficients of the
   hyperplanes are also calculated for evaluating the quality and
   reliability of the approximation. The proposed approach is tested on the
   China Southern Power Grid (CSG). Results of simulations validate the
   accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach in approximating the
   TSRB.}},

Title = {{What are the relative risks of mortality and injury for fish during
   downstream passage at hydroelectric dams in temperate regions? A
   systematic review}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Background Fish injury and mortality resulting from entrainment and/or
   impingement during downstream passage over/through hydropower
   infrastructure has the potential to cause negative effects on fish
   populations. The primary goal of this systematic review was to address
   two research questions: (1) What are the consequences of hydroelectric
   dam fish entrainment and impingement on freshwater fish productivity in
   temperate regions?; (2) To what extent do various factors like site
   type, intervention type, and life history characteristics influence the
   consequences of fish entrainment and impingement? Methods The review was
   conducted using guidelines provided by the Collaboration for
   Environmental Evidence and examined commercially published and grey
   literature. All articles found using a systematic search were screened
   using a priori eligibility criteria at two stages (title and abstract,
   and full-text, respectively), with consistency checks being performed at
   each stage. The validity of studies was appraised and data were
   extracted using tools explicitly designed for this review. A narrative
   synthesis encompassed all relevant studies and a quantitative synthesis
   (meta-analysis) was conducted where appropriate. Review findings A total
   of 264 studies from 87 articles were included for critical appraisal and
   narrative synthesis. Studies were primarily conducted in the United
   States (93\%) on genera in the Salmonidae family (86\%). The evidence
   base did not allow for an evaluation of the consequences of
   entrainment/impingement on fish productivity per se; therefore, we
   evaluated the risk of freshwater fish injury and mortality owing to
   downstream passage through common hydropower infrastructure. Our
   quantitative synthesis suggested an overall increased risk of injury and
   immediate mortality from passage through/over hydropower infrastructure.
   Injury and immediate mortality risk varied among infrastructure types.
   Bypasses resulted in decreased injury risk relative to controls, whereas
   turbines and spillways were associated with the highest injury risks
   relative to controls. Within turbine studies, those conducted in a lab
   setting were associated with higher injury risk than field-based
   studies, and studies with longer assessment time periods (>= 24-48 h)
   were associated with higher risk than shorter duration assessment
   periods (< 24 h). Turbines and sluiceways were associated with the
   highest immediate mortality risk relative to controls. Within turbine
   studies, lab-based studies had higher mortality risk ratios than
   field-based studies. Within field studies, Francis turbines resulted in
   a higher immediate mortality risk than Kaplan turbines relative to
   controls, and wild sourced fish had a higher immediate mortality risk
   than hatchery sourced fish in Kaplan turbines. No other associations
   between effect size and moderators were identified. Taxonomic analyses
   revealed a significant increased injury and immediate mortality risk
   relative to controls for genera Alosa (river herring) and Oncorhynchus
   (Pacific salmonids), and delayed mortality risk for Anguilla (freshwater
   eels). Conclusions Our synthesis suggests that hydropower infrastructure
   in temperate regions increased the overall risk of freshwater fish
   injury and immediate mortality relative to controls. The evidence base
   confirmed that turbines and spillways increase the risk of injury and/or
   mortality for downstream passing fish compared to controls.
   Differences in lab- and field-based studies were evident, highlighting
   the need for further studies to understand the sources of variation
   among lab- and field-based studies. We were unable to examine delayed
   mortality, likely due to the lack of consistency in monitoring for
   post-passage delayed injury and mortality. Our synthesis suggests that
   bypasses are the most ``fish friendly{''} passage option in terms of
   reducing fish injury and mortality. To address knowledge gaps, studies
   are needed that focus on systems outside of North America, on
   non-salmonid or non-sportfish target species, and on population-level

Abstract = {{There is a proactive interest in recovering water, nutrients and energy
   from waste streams with the increase in municipal wastewater volumes and
   innovations in resource recovery. Based on the synthesis of wastewater
   data, this study provides insights into the global and regional
   ``potential{''} of wastewater as water, nutrient and energy sources
   while acknowledging the limitations of current resource recovery
   opportunities and promoting efforts to fast-track high-efficiency
   returns. The study estimates suggest that, currently, 380 billion m(3)
   (m(3) = 1,000 L) of wastewater are produced annually across the world
   which is a volume five-fold the volume of water passing through Niagara
   Falls annually. Wastewater production globally is expected to increase
   by 24\% by 2030 and 51\% by 2050 over the current level. Among major
   nutrients, 16.6 Tg (Tg = million metric ton) of nitrogen are embedded in
   wastewater produced worldwide annually; phosphorus stands at 3.0 Tg and
   potassium at 6.3 Tg. The full nutrient recovery from wastewater would
   offset 13.4\% of the global demand for these nutrients in agriculture.
   Beyond nutrient recovery and economic gains, there are critical
   environmental benefits, such as minimizing eutrophication. At the energy
   front, the energy embedded in wastewater would be enough to provide
   electricity to 158 million households. These estimates and projections
   are based on the maximum theoretical amounts of water, nutrients and
   energy that exist in the reported municipal wastewater produced
   worldwide annually. Supporting resource recovery from wastewater will
   need a step-wise approach to address a range of constraints to deliver a
   high rate of return in direct support of Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDG) 6, 7 and 12, but also other Goals, including adaptation to climate
   change and efforts in advancing ``net-zero{''} energy processes towards
   a green economy.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{36}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{There are 104 hydroelectric facilities proposed to be installed in the
   watersheds that feed the Pantanal, a vast floodplain wetland located
   mostly in Brazil. The Pantanal is host to 23 long-distance migratory
   fish species that ascend upland tributaries to spawn. A Geographic
   Information System was used to predict the impact of hydroelectric dams
   on potential migration routes for these species. Both anthropogenic
   (hydroelectric dams) and natural barriers were included in the analysis.
   Natural barriers were identified by river slope. Critical river slopes
   of 10 and 25\%, above which fish were predicted to be incapable of
   ascending, were modeled as natural barriers. Based on this model, we
   show that between 2 and 14\% of rivers in the Pantanal watershed are
   naturally blocked to fish migration. An additional 5 to 9\% of rivers
   are currently blocked due to 35 existing hydroelectric facilities. If
   all proposed dams are built, the area flooded by new reservoirs will
   triple and the river kilometers blocked will double, blocking 25 to 32\%
   of the river system to fish migration. The Taquari and Cuiaba River
   sub-basins will be the most impacted, each having more than 70\% of
   their rivers blocked. The impact of individual proposed facilities on
   the loss of migration routes is related to their proximity to existing
   barriers. Fourteen of the proposed dams are upstream from existing
   barriers and will therefore not further restrict long-distance fish
   migration routes while proposed dams are predicted to close an
   additional 11,000 to 12,000 km of river channels.}},

Abstract = {{Water and energy resource are inextricably linked. Rapid
   industrialization has led to severe water and energy shortage as well as
   environmental issues in China. In industrial sector, industrial
   production and wastewater treatment are two interdependent subsystems.
   Accordingly, understanding the internal operation performance of the two
   subsystems as well as assessing their coordination level are of great
   importance for sustainable water and energy usage. From the perspective
   of production efficiency, this paper aims to explore industrial
   water-energy nexus in China by proposing an interactive meta-frontier
   network DEA approach. The proposed approach is applied to assess the
   industrial water and energy utilization efficiency in the processes of
   industrial production and wastewater treatment from 2011 to 2015 in
   China. The results show that although eastern and central regions have
   high industrial production efficiency, most regions have relatively low
   wastewater treatment efficiency. In addition, the nexus degree of
   eastern region maintains a relatively high level and shows a stable
   improvement, while the rest two regions perform relatively worse.
   Comparing the central and western region, the industrial production
   technology of central region is better yet the wastewater treatment
   efficiencies of western region are higher, which results in higher nexus
   degree of western region. Based on the empirical results, policy
   implications are given in terms of national level, regional level and
   provincial level, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Energy security is an issue at stake in governments all over the world,

   for energy security. In high -throughput seasons, excess energy could be
   used to produce hydrogen, which could supply shortages of energy. This
   study shows the potential for producing hydrogen in Brazil, using excess
   energy from hydroelectric and wind farms. Taking into account one hour
   per day of surplus energy production, it would be possible to generate
   6.50E+09 Nm(3).y(-1) of H-2. On the other hand, considering two and
   three hours, the H-2 generation would be equal to 1.30E+10 Nm(3).y(-1)
   and 2.00E+10 Nm(3).y(-1), respectively. This study calculated the

Abstract = {{Given energy and water scarcity, it is necessary to develop an in-depth
   understanding of the energy-water nexus in China for its sustainable
   development. Previous studies have focused on nexus accounting, synergy
   conservation, and system optimization, but its induction mechanism along
   the supply chains has not been uncovered. This paper proposes a top-down
   structural path analysis (SPA) and combines it with an environmental
   input-output model (EIOM) to identify the critical final demand,
   consumption sectors, and supply chain paths inducing the energy-water
   nexus. The results show that the largest final demand of water for
   energy production (WFE) is capital formation, while the largest final
   demand of energy for water supply (EFW) is urban consumption. The
   distribution of WFE at different production layers shows an inverted U
   shape. Most WFE is indirectly consumed by other sectors, such as
   construction, through three-step supply chain paths. In contrast, the
   distribution of EFW shows a L shape, and most EFW is directly consumed
   by the final demand. In addition, some critical supply chain paths
   inducing more WFE and EFW are identified. Finally, some policies
   targeting the energy-water nexus management are proposed, which are
   conducive to resource conservation and the sustainable supply of energy

   previous study, the present paper analyzes the use of MCA in a real case
   study of HP sustainable management in Aosta Valley, one of the most
   important Italian regions for HP production. The Simple Additive
   Weighting (SAW) methodology was applied to quantify the flow to be
   released by an existing HP plant, in order to balance production needs
   and watercourse environmental conditions protection considering four
   criteria (Energy, Environment \& Fishing, Landscape, and Economy). The
   decisional process was developed within a collaborative and

   evenly distributed downstream of Hydroelectric Dam. Specimens were
   collected monthly for one year, from six sites of Rio Grande river. The
   specimens were sexed and measured (carapace length; CL). A total of
   14,697 adults were captured, 2,864 males (AM), 11,082 non-breeding

   over the collection sites. Breeding females were more abundant in the
   sites closest to the dam. This result can be explained by rainfall,
   which varied significantly throughout the year. As the breeding females
   migrated upstream toward the dam and were more abundant there, our
   hypothesis of homogeneous distribution was rejected. This behavior
   probably optimizes larval dispersion. The reproduction was continuous
   with peaks in the period preceding the maximum rainfall.}},

   Based on Steady-State Security Region}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{139221-139243}},
Abstract = {{The large-scale shift of power flow after DC blocking will seriously
   affect the secure operation of the system. Furthermore, after DC
   blocking, the system uses different control objectives in different
   operation stages. Therefore, a two-stage coordinated control of AC/DC
   hybrid power system based on steady-state security region (SSR) is
   proposed. Firstly, after DC blocking, the system needs to quickly
   restore secure operation with minimum cost. Therefore, the security
   correction guidance vector and the security distance sensitivity of the
   different control variables to it are obtained based on the linear
   fitting of the boundary surfaces of the SSR. The control cost of
   different control variables is characterized by the expansion and
   contraction of the SSR. According to the sensitivity of each control
   variable to the guidance vector and their actual adjustment ability,
   they are sorted and substituted into the security correction model to
   minimize the total adjustment cost during the process. Secondly, system
   will frequently be in a critical security state and not able to meet the
   needs of long-term secure and economic operation after security
   correction. Therefore, the security and economics of the system after
   security correction are comprehensively evaluated with the system
   generation cost, voltage deviation, and security margin under normal
   operating conditions and N-1 contingency conditions of heavy load lines.
   By calculating the security distance sensitivity of each control
   variable to the transmission limit of the crucial section, the sensitive

Abstract = {{This research work aims to provide detailed feasibility, a
   techno-economic evaluation, and energy management of stand-alone hybrid
   photovoltaic-diesel-battery (PV/DG/B) system. The proposed system can be
   applied to supply a specific load that is far away from the utility grid
   (UG) connection, and it is located in Minya city, Egypt, as a real case
   study. The daily required desalinated water is 250 m(3). The total
   brackish water demands are 350-500 m(3) and 250-300 m(3) of water in
   summer and winter seasons, respectively. Two different sizes of reverse
   osmosis (RO) units; RO-250 and RO-500, two energy control dispatch
   strategies; load following (LF) and cycle charging (CC); two sizes of
   DG; 5 kW and 10 kW are considered in the case study. The cost of energy,
   renewable fraction, environmental impact, and breakeven grid extension
   distance are the main criteria that have been considered to determine
   the optimal size of PV/DG/B to supply the load demand. HOME (R) software
   is used to perform the simulation and optimization. For this case study,
   the minimum cost of energy and the minimum total present cost are 0.074
   \$/kWh and 207676 \$ respectively. This is achieved by using a RO-500
   unit and a LF dispatch control strategy. The related sizes to the best
   option of PV/DG/B are 120 kW PV array, 10 kW DG, 64 batteries, and 50 kW
   converter. A comparison with grid extension and installing stand-alone
   diesel generation is also carried out. The results of comparison have
   confirmed that the grid connection is better than all considered options
   using the RO-250 unit. However, for the RO-500 unit, all options of
   hybrid PV/DG/B are more economically feasible compared with grid
   connection, and the best cost-effective option is the one including LF
   strategy with 10 kW DG. Stand-alone diesel generator produces 119110
   kg/year and 117677 kg/year of CO2 respectively for RO-250 and RO-500.}},

Title = {{Distribution of Siluriformes in a river under the influence of a small
   hydroelectric power plant of the Parana River Basin, Brazil}},
Journal = {{IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{110}},
Abstract = {{When a river is dammed, impacts differ according to distance from the
   dam under consideration, and sites closer to the dam are more affected
   than distant ones. Damming a river changes the flow and landscape
   characteristics, which, in turn, change the hydrological, limnological
   and ecological dynamics, such as biological production, species
   distribution, and ecosystem structuring, functioning and services. This
   study evaluates the distribution pattern of the Siluriformes (catfish)
   fish species near a small hydroelectric power plant in the Jaguariaiva
   River, considering three distinct distances from the dam: upstream
   region, reservoir and downstream region. Samples were taken with
   gillnets between March 2013 and December 2014. The abundance and
   richness of the Siluriformes species were evaluated. A permutational
   multivariate analysis of variance was used to access possible
   differences in species composition among sites. Finally, a permutational
   analysis of multivariate dispersion was used to assess possible
   differences among sampling sites and to examine composition similarities
   among sites. Atotal of 840 Siluriformes individuals were captured,
   distributed among ten species and four families. The highest richness
   was observed in the downstream region, while the lowest richness was
   observed in the reservoir area. Differences in the abundance of species
   were observed between the three distinct regions; the downstream region
   presented the highest species abundance (CPUE), whereas the lowest
   abundance was observed in the dam region. Hypostomus paulinus and
   Hypostomus strigaticeps were abundant species, but exclusively sampled
   in the downstream region, while Corydoras ehrhardti and Cambeva diabola
   presented their highest abundance in the upstream region. The distinct
   longitudinal distribution of Siluriformes observed in this study can be
   interpreted as indicative of the negative effects of damming Our study
   suggests that building small dams may result in negative impacts on the
   fish assemblage, impacts comparable to those of large reservoirs in
   terms of spatial changes. It is fundamentally necessary to better
   evaluate the environmental impacts of small dams in the Neotropical
   region, especially because few is known about them and how such impacts
   are comparable to impacts of larger reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel multi-stage fuzzy stochastic programming (MSFSP)
   model was developed for regional energy system structure optimization
   and planning with energy-water nexus under multiple uncertainties. By
   cooperating the multistage stochastic programming and fuzzy theory, the
   developed model can deal with energy system planning problems under a
   mixture of probabilistic and possibilistic uncertainties. Fuzzy random
   scenarios are designed to express the uncertain future energy demand
   levels and vague decision maker's risk attitude. A MSFSP -based
   energy-water nexus system management model was applied to a practical
   energy system planning problem in an energy-intensive and water-stressed
   area, Tianjin, China. Results of optimal capacity expansion, power
   generation, and imported electricity strategies were obtained; meanwhile
   the water resource availability effects and decision makers' risk
   attitude were analyzed. It was found that water resource availability
   would be a significant factor in promoting local power structure and
   electricity generation in the future. More serious water resource
   deficiency would lead to reduce local coal-fired power capacity
   investment, while stimulate renewable energy development and increase
   imported electricity requirement. All above can facilitate decision
   supports for regional energy system planning from a comprehensive
   energy-water nexus perspective with more sustainable and risk-aversion

   Regions under Uncertainties}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Energy, water, and environment are inextricably interwoven in the
   complex social and economic networks. This study proposes an
   optimization model for planning the energy-water-environment nexus
   system (EWENS) through incorporating the linear autoregressive
   integrated moving average model prediction model (ARIMA), Monte Carlo
   simulation, chance-constrained programming (CCP), and type-2 fuzzy
   programming (T2FP) into one general framework. This method effectively
   tackles type-2 fuzzy set and stochastic uncertainties. The proposed
   model can quantitatively explore the interconnections between water,
   energy, and environment systems and generate an optimized solution for
   EWENS. The proposed model was applied to a coal-dominated region of
   China, i.e., Inner Mongolia. Several findings and policy implications
   were obtained. First, the total water supply for energy-generating
   activities will range from 1368.10 x 10(6) m(3) to 1370.62 x 10(6) m(3),
   at the end of planning periods. Second, the electricity for water supply
   will range from 2164.07 x 10(6) kWh to 2167.65 x 10(6) kWh at the end of
   the planning periods, with a growth rate of 46.06-48.72\%. Thirdly,
   lifecycle carbon dioxide emission (LCDE) is projected to range from
   931.85 x 10(6) tons to 947.00 x 10(6) tons at the end of the planning
   periods. Wastewater and SO2, NOx, and particulate matter (PM) emissions
   are projected to be 42.72 x 10(3)-43.45 x 10(3) tons, 183.07 x
   10(3)-186.23 x 10(3) tons, 712.38 x 10(3)-724.73 x 10(3) tons, and 38.14
   x 10(3)-38.80 x 10(3) tons at the end of the planning periods. Fourthly,
   as the largest electricity-exporting city of China, Inner Mongolia's
   electricity outflows will export 1435.78 x 10(6) m(3) of virtual water
   to other regions, implying that Inner Mongolia is pumping its important
   water resource to support other regions' electricity demands. Finally,
   high carbon mitigation levels can effectively optimize the electricity
   power mix, reduce consumption amounts of water and coal, and mitigate
   air pollutants, wastewater, and LCDE. The obtained results provide
   useful information for managers to develop a sustainability plan for the
   EWENS.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Climate change could have dire effects on hydropower systems, especially
   in southwest China, where hydropower dominates the regional power
   system. This study examines two large cascade hydropower systems in
   Yunnan province in southwest China for 10 climate change projections
   made with 5 global climate models (GCMs) and 2 representative
   concentration pathways (RCPs) under Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). First, a back propagation neural network
   rain-runoff model is built for each hydropower station to estimate
   inflows with climate change. Then, a progressive optimality algorithm
   maximizes hydropower generation for each projection. The results show
   generation increasing in each GCM projection, but increasing more in
   GCMs under scenario RCP8.5. However, yearly generation fluctuates more:
   generation decreases dramatically with potential for electricity
   shortages in dry years and more electricity as well as spill during wet
   years. Average annual spill, average annual inflow and average storage
   have similar trends. The analysis indicates that a planned large dam on
   the upper Jinsha River would increase seasonal regulation ability,
   increase hydropower generation, and decrease spill. Increased turbine
   capacity increases generation slightly and decreases spill for the
   Lancang River. Results from this study demonstrate effects of climate

   agro-pastoral ecotone, Northwest China}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{580}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A better understanding of responses of the regional water-energy cycle
   to land use/cover change (LUCC) is important for ecological restoration
   in the agro-pastoral ecotone, Northwest China (APENWC). In this study,
   we examined the responses to various types of LUCC in the APENWC during
   the implementation of the Grain-forGreen project between 1993 and 2010
   using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. The performance
   of the WRF model was validated by multiple types of observations.
   Results show that the WRF can accurately simulate regional water and
   energy processes in the APENWC, and that the water-energy cycles in the
   region are strongly affected by vegetation dynamics. During the period
   of 1993 and 2010, the most obviously increased land cover types were the
   grassland and barren land, and the decreased land cover types were
   shrublands and croplands in the study region. A significantly negative
   correlation (R-2 = 0.78) between land surface temperature (LST) and
   albedo was found, associated with a 0.5 degrees C reduction in the
   annual mean surface temperature in the APENWC between 1993 and 2010.
   Negative correlations between changes in evapotranspiration (ET) and
   albedo during the period in all seasons were also detected, except
   summer, when the correlation was positive (R-2 = 0.49). This is
   attributed to transpiration from plants being the main contributor to ET
   in summer and, hence total ET. The changes resulted in an increase of ET
   by 19.79 mm in summer, and decreases of ET by 1.15 mm, 13.22 mm, and
   0.96 mm, respectively, in spring, fall, and winter. The LUCC also
   resulted in reductions in precipitation (of 2.3, 7.31, and 7.8 mm in
   spring, summer, and fall, respectively) by altering local ET and vapor
   flux cycles in the APENWC, and the study region contributed additional
   moisture from the local ET into the north of the region. The findings
   show that the grassland expansion reduces mean land surface temperature,
   which will delay germination of seeds and initiation of vegetation
   growth in spring. Increases in seasonal ET and reductions in seasonal
   precipitation will lead to soil drying, exacerbating risks of summer
   drought in the APENWC. The findings provide important information in
   facilitating formulation of effective strategies for sustainable
   development and ecological restoration in the APENWC and similar
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{Water and energy are intertwined during their production and consumption
   processes. Static assessments and simulations of the water-energy nexus
   among production and consumption are important for determining the
   mechanism behind the nexus; however, dynamic studies can help determine
   the most important factors that influence the development of the
   water-energy nexus, which can provide new insights for shaping energy
   and water synergetic management. Thus, we probed the driving factors of
   the water-energy nexus in China through structural decomposition
   analysis from 1990 to 2014 and decomposed the water consumption of
   different consumers into six energy related factors: the water-energy
   nexus coefficient, the energy intensity, the production structure, the
   consumption volume per capita of final consumers, consumption patterns,
   and the population. The results showed that the consumption volume,
   which indicates the consumption levels of different consumers,
   contributed 156\% of the increase of the total energy related water
   consumption in 2014 compared with that in 1990. Additionally, the energy
   intensity is the most important driving factor that can reduce the total
   water consumption of all consumers (household, government, gross fixed
   capital format, etc.), accounting for -271\% of the water consumption in
   2014. The consumption patterns, i.e., expenditures on various products
   in different sectors, also show positive impacts on water consumption
   conservation for the gross fixed capital format and government, although
   they can aggravate the water consumption in households. The
   investigation of the driving forces for different consumers also shows
   that prosperity in the real estate industry and other related industries
   has indirectly driven more water flow into gross fixed capital
   investments and the government, which negatively affects the sustainable
   water consumption goal in China.}},

Abstract = {{It's anticipated that future expansion of energy industry in China will
   inevitably exert enormous pressure on water use both at home and abroad,
   due to the globalized energy supply chains. Therefore, this study aims
   to systematically evaluate the global water use embodied in China's
   energy supply chains (i.e., energy supply, demand and international
   trade) in a unified framework by using a global multi-regional
   input-output analysis. The results reveal that China's direct water
   withdrawal by energy sectors (i.e., coal, oil, gas, petroleum and
   electricity) amounts to 117 billion m(3) in 2011, of which foreign
   demand mainly from USA, EU28 and Japan drives one quarter. From energy
   demand side, only water roughly equivalent to one fifth of direct water
   withdrawal of energy sectors is embodied in China's final demand of
   energy sectors, indicating that energy sectors transfer large amounts of
   water embodied in intermediate use to downstream sectors. Regarding
   water use embodied in China's energy trade, China mainly imports from
   XSU (Rest of Former Soviet Union), Russia and Korea, and exports to
   Vietnam, Singapore and XEA (Rest of East Asia). Although much of the
   discussion around China's energy-water nexus is focused on local
   perspective, our findings highlight the importance to consider the
   impacts of China's globalized energy supply chains on worldwide water
   use when formulating policy.}},

Abstract = {{The large amount of electricity generation is exerting tremendous

Title = {{Towards a smart grid power system in Brazil: Challenges and
   opportunities}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{136}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The prospects for a smart power system have been widely discussed in the
   global electricity sector. Decarbonization, Digitalization and
   Decentralization are considered the main key drivers for this power
   system transition and Brazil is no exception to this universal trend. A
   search of the literature revealed few studies which attempt to address
   the main challenges and opportunities towards a smart grid power system
   in Brazil. This paper provides an up-to-date assessment of the present
   and potential capabilities of existing and future technologies,
   regulations and policies and attempts to identify how these elements are
   interrelated. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting
   that policies for Distributed Generation (DG), Demand-Side Management
   (DSM) and new tariff schemes are on a path of accelerated deployment in
   the country. The deployment of storage technologies, however, is at a
   slow pace of growth. We highlight the need to further develop new
   business models to address the various decentralized energy technologies
   and services that are emerging in the sector. The current netmetering
   system is considered a key issue to be addressed as this regulatory
   structure may shift the costs from DG to non-DG users.}},

Title = {{A review of hydropower dams in Southeast Europe - distribution, trends
   and availability of monitoring data using the example of a multinational
   Danube catchment subarea}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Currently, Southeast Europe (SEE) is witnessing a boom in hydropower
   plant (HPP) construction, which has not even spared protected areas. As
   SEE includes global hotspots of aquatic biodiversity, it is expected
   that this boom will result in a more severe impact on biodiversity than
   that of other regions. A more detailed assessment of the environmental
   risks resulting from HPP construction would have to rely on the
   existence of nearby hydrological and biological monitoring stations.
   For this reason, we review the distribution and trends of HPPs in the
   area, as well as the availability of hydrological and biological
   monitoring data from national institutions useable for environmental
   impact assessment. Our analysis samples tributary rivers of the Danube
   in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Montenegro,
   referred to hereafter as TRD rivers.
   Currently, 636 HPPs are operating along the course of TRD rivers, most
   of which are small (<1 MW). An additional 1315 HPPs are currently
   planned to be built, mostly in Serbia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As
   official monitoring stations near HPPs are rare, the impact of those
   HPPs on river flow, fish and macro-invertebrates is difficult to assess.
   This manuscript represents the first regional review of hydropower use
   and of available data sources on its environmental impact for an area
   outside of the Alps. We conclude that current hydrological and
   biological monitoring in TRD rivers is insufficient for an assessment of
   the ecological impacts of HPPs. This data gap also prevents an adequate
   assessment of the ecological impacts of planned HP projects, as well as
   the identification of appropriate measures to mitigate the environmental
   effects of existing HPPs.}},

Abstract = {{Analyzing the impact of climate change on China's hydropower system can
   make great contribution to understanding the feedback mechanism of the
   climate change on energy system. In this work, an econometric model for
   regional hydropower generation is constructed to explore the impact of
   climate factors on hydropower generation in different regions of China
   by using the monthly panel data of 28 provinces in China. Further, we
   also make a prediction for the changes of hydropower generation in China
   caused by the changes of climatic factors under the three climate change
   scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) proposed in the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) fifth assessment report. The results
   show that: (1) At the national level, the influences of climatic factors
   on hydropower generation are significant, the elasticity coefficients of
   rainfall, heating degree day (HDD), cooling degree day (CDD) and
   sunshine duration are 0.081, -0.016, 0.089 and -0.043 respectively. (2)
   The impacts of climatic factors on the hydropower generation in the
   northern and southern regions of China are different. The effect of
   rainfall on the hydropower generation is significant in the southern
   regions, but not in the northern region. The CDD has a significant
   effect on both the northern and southern regions, and the latter is
   greater (0.136\%). The impact of HDD on the northern area is
   significant, while its influence on the southern area is not
   significant. The influence of sunshine duration is not significant in
   any region in China. (3) Compared with the year of 2011, the total
   changes of hydropower output caused by climate factors by 2100 under the
   RCP8.5, RCP4.5 and RCP2.6 scenarios are 153.29 billion kWh, 67.49
   billion kWh and 22.10 billion kWh, respectively. The results imply that
   the hydropower is sensitive and vulnerable to climate fluctuation,
   leading to many uncertainties for its development in the future.

   hydropower in China. (C) 2018 International Association for Mathematics

Abstract = {{As a water-intensive industry, iron and steel production has caused
   serious water resource problems in China. This paper first proposes a
   material flow analysis-input-output model that considers water use
   factors and system boundaries for a life cycle water analysis. The life
   cycle water use and wastewater discharge inventories of different
   products are quantified, and water flow diagrams of life cycle water
   withdrawal, consumption and discharge for a steel plant in China are
   graphically mapped. The results show that the total life cycle water
   withdrawal, water consumption and water discharge per ton of steel in
   the case plant were 14.93 t, 5.90 t, and 9.23 t. The steelmaking process
   constituted the largest fraction, while the cold rolling processes
   constituted the smallest fraction. By analyzing the direct and indirect
   water and material-energy-water flow, the indirect water usage in energy
   and material flows was found to be more important to the water flow in
   the life cycle water use and discharge for steel production, especially
   for electricity. However, there were many differences among the
   subprocesses. In coking and sintering, the main factor was material
   flow; for ironmaking, water flow; for steelmaking, energy and water
   flows; and for hot rolling and cold rolling, energy flow. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Given its total contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, the global
   electric power sector will be required to undergo a fundamental
   transformation over the next decades to limit anthropogenic climate
   change to below 2 degrees C. Implications for biodiversity of projected
   structural changes in the global electric power sector are rarely
   considered beyond those explicitly linked to climate change. This study
   uses a spatially explicit consumption-based accounting framework to
   examine the impact of demand for electric power on terrestrial
   vertebrate biodiversity globally. We demonstrate that the biodiversity
   footprint of the electric power sector is primarily within the territory
   where final demand for electric power resides, although there are
   substantial regional differences, with Europe displacing its
   biodiversity threat along international supply chains. The relationship
   between size of individual components of the electric power sector and
   threat to biodiversity indicates that a shift to nonfossil sources, such
   as solar and wind, could reduce pressures on biodiversity both within
   the territory where demand for power resides and along international
   supply chains. However, given the current levels of deployment of
   nonfossil sources of power, there is considerable uncertainty as to how
   the impacts of structural changes in the global electric power system
   will scale. Given the strong territorial link between demand and
   associated biodiversity impacts, development of strong national
   governance around the electric power sector represents a clear route to
   mitigate threats to biodiversity associated with efforts to decarbonize
   society over the coming century.}},

Abstract = {{PV technologies are increasingly making significant contribution to

   These technologies however rely on metals that are identified as

   that require energy and water for their production. In this paper, a
   comprehensive assessment of required materials for PV technologies, an
   analysis of their materials inflows, outflows, and stocks, an estimate
   of their maximum contribution to global energy scenarios (GES), and an
   estimate of energy and water required for their material production and

   GEG in future. The three commercial thin-film PV technologies could

Abstract = {{The provision of cooling in a high-capacity trigeneration system is
   challenging due to the huge difference in the energy performance between

   waste heat is solely used to drive a desiccant dehumidification cycle in
   a hybrid cooling system which offers better energy performance for use
   in hot and humid regions. Thus, given the availability of small-capacity
   solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), a SOFC-primed micro-combined hybrid
   cooling and power (mCHyCP) system was developed, and its performance in
   a 24-h restaurant in Singapore and in Hong Kong was analyzed. It was
   found that by performing year-round dynamic simulations using TRNSYS, a
   10\% reduction in the total electricity demand could be achieved in the
   tropical Singaporean climate compared to a 5\% reduction in demand in
   the sub-tropical Hong Kong climate. This reflected the effect of
   different seasons on the performance of the mCHyCP system. In addition,
   at most 24\% and 38\% reductions in the primary energy consumption and

Abstract = {{With a severe seasonal concentration of precipitation and unevenly

   Water desalination is increasingly becoming the preferred solution to
   fight water scarcity, but, because it is energy-intensive, the

   chosen remain a challenge to its implementation. This study aims to
   assess if the introduction of renewable energy sources (RES) powered
   desalination in mainland Portugal is viable and can contribute to
   guarantee water security. The Portuguese Algarve region is a viable case
   study to be considered because it is particularly water stressed and
   subject to highly varying demographics depending on the season. Taking
   the region's freshwater demand, hourly RES production and power demand,
   a cost analysis was performed in order to obtain the levelized cost of
   water (LCOW) for two different strategies (centralized and
   decentralized). Two models were developed to estimate the LCOW: a
   simplified model and a subsequent optimization model, minimizing
   electricity costs. The resulting LCOW of 72.66 c(sic)/m(3), obtained for
   the decentralized solution, fits within the industry standard rate
   despite being 61.3\% higher than the estimated conventional water supply

Abstract = {{Line loss is inherent in transmission and distribution stages, which can

   However, the number of regions is usually very large, and the dataset of

   regularization and Huber loss function. It can achieve several different
   outputs, which are utilized to compute benchmark values and reasonable
   intervals. Based on the comparison results, the proposed RNN possesses
   both superb robustness and accuracy, which outperforms the testing
   conventional regression models. According to the benchmark analysis,

Abstract = {{The directionality of the response of gross primary productivity (GPP)
   to climate has been shown to vary across the globe. This effect has been
   hypothesized to be the result of the interaction between multiple
   bioclimatic factors, including environmental energy (i.e. temperature
   and radiation) and water availability. This is due to the tight coupling
   between water and carbon cycling in plants and the fact that temperature
   often drives plant water demand. Using GPP data extracted from 188 sites
   of FLUXNET20 15 and observation-driven terrestrial biosphere models
   (TBMs), we disentangled the confounding effects of temperature,
   precipitation and carbon dioxide on GPP, and examined their long-term
   effects on productivity across the globe. Based on the FLUXNET2015 data,
   we observed a decline in the positive effect of temperature on GPP,
   while the positive effects of precipitation and CO2 were becoming
   stronger during 2000-2014. Using data derived from TBMs between 1980 and
   2010 we found similar effects globally. The modeled data allowed us to
   investigate these effects more thoroughly over space and time. In arid
   regions, the modeled response to precipitation increased since 1950,
   approximately 30 years earlier than in humid regions. We further
   observed the negative effects of summer temperature on GPP in arid
   regions, suggesting greater aridity stress on productivity under global
   warming. Our results imply that aridity stress, triggered by rising
   temperatures, has reduced the positive influence of temperature on GPP,
   while increased precipitation and elevated CO2 may alleviate negative

Title = {{Identifying Efficient Operating Rules for Hydropower Reservoirs Using

Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the long-term operation of hydropower reservoirs, operating rules
   have been used widely to decide reservoir operation because they can
   help operators make an approximately optimal decision with limited
   runoff information. However, the problems faced by reservoir managers is
   how to make and select an efficient operating rule properly. This study
   focuses on identifying efficient and reliable operating rules for the
   long-term operation of hydropower reservoirs using system dynamics (SD)
   approach. A stochastic hydrological model of reservoir inflow time
   series was established and used to generate a large number of inflow
   scenarios. A deterministic optimization operation model of hydropower
   reservoirs was constructed and then resolved using dynamic programming
   (DP) algorithm. Simultaneously, within implicit stochastic optimization
   (ISO) framework, different operating rules were derived using linear
   fitting methods. Finally, the most efficient one of the existing
   operating rules was identified based on SD simulation coupled with the
   operating rules. The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in central China was
   used as a case study. The results show that the SD simulation is an
   efficient way to simulate a complicated reservoir system using feedback
   and causal loops. Moreover, it can directly and efficiently guide
   reservoir managers to make and identify efficient operating rules for
   the long-term operation of hydropower reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{A strategy for evaluating a global shallow water model based on aspects
   of kinetic energy spectra and nonlinear vorticity dynamics is proposed
   in this study. The kinetic energy spectra and nonlinear vorticity
   dynamics of a recently developed global shallow water model on an
   unstructured mesh are evaluated in comparison with the benchmark
   solutions from a global high-resolution spectral model. The results show
   that the kinetic energy spectra, the rotational and divergent
   components, the stationary and transient components, and the nonlinear
   spectral fluxes of the developed shallow water model agree well with
   those generated by the reference model. In addition, the influence of
   different flux operators for transporting the potential vorticity (PV)
   is assessed specifically. It is indicated that the second-order flux
   operator leads to a spurious increase in the kinetic energy at the tail
   of the spectrum, whereas the upwind third-order flux operator does not
   support this behavior owing to implicit numerical diffusion. Moreover,
   the nonlinear vorticity dynamics is studied by using colliding modons.
   It is found that the grid-point model maintains the symmetrical pattern
   of vortices, and generates similar kinetic energy spectra and nonlinear
   spectral fluxes to the reference model. The evaluation provides a
   reference for assessing the shallow water model in terms of nonlinear
   dynamics, and the developed global shallow water model presents a good
   example.}},

   approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{579}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The uncertainties in atmospheric water demand used in evaluating drought
   indices are the primary cause of discrepancies between them, especially
   in water-limited regions. This study evaluated Standardized Moisture
   Anomaly Index (SZI) using a combined water-energy balance approach, and
   compared the performance with the Standardized Precipitation
   Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and self-calibrated Palmer Drought
   Severity Index (ScPDSI) over seven climatic regions in China from 1948
   to 2017. The atmospheric water demand in SZI is evaluated using
   climatically appropriate precipitation for existing conditions (CAFEC),
   which takes into account most parts of the surface water-energy balance
   (i.e., precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture
   recharge and loss). The relative performances of SZI, SPEI, and ScPDSI
   for multicategory and multi-scalar drought identification are reported
   in terms of Pearson correlation coefficient. Through a series of
   cross-comparisons, our result explains that the SZI, SPEI, and ScPDSI
   drought indices presented dissimilar abilities in different regions,
   which of course, raises the issue of regional applicability. The
   performance of SZI is better than SPEI and ScPDSI in both humid and
   non-humid regions. Although the consistency of SPEI is similar to SZI
   across different temporal scale, it is more appropriate for multi-scalar
   drought analysis in humid regions. The ScPDSI are inconsistent in
   identifying multicategory drought. The enhanced drought appraisal with
   the SZI is the consequence of a more objective evaluation of atmospheric
   water demand by incorporating precipitation, runoff, and change in water
   storage, all that control meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural
   droughts, respectively. The SZI can offer a better multi-category and
   multi-scalar droughts information, which could aid in providing valuable
   early warning of rapidly evolving drought most notably in the

Abstract = {{Solar energy is considered as a potential solution for meeting the
   electrical needs in remote areas having no access to utility grid.
   However, its intermittent nature and dependence on geographical location
   possess a major challenge to design renewable energy system for
   sustainable utilization of solar energy. In this study, site-specific
   solar resource assessment using statistical parameters, HOMER based
   techno-economic assessment, and environmental impact analysis are done
   to design an optimal solar PV-battery based system for water supply
   station of a remote area of Silchar, India. The results show that two
   years' average daily accumulated global solar radiation is 3.67
   kWh/m(2)-day and the clearness index reveals that 73.5\% of the days
   have partly clear or complete clear sky conditions. The Linke turbidity
   factor ranges from 3.5 to 5.5. The HOMER simulation results show that
   257,014 kWh of energy is produced annually by the PV-battery system and
   the per-unit cost of energy is found to be \$0.307/kWh. The
   environmental analysis shows that a maximum 98.16\% reduction in CO2

Journal = {{RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{151}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The energy industry in China is responsible for the largest water
   withdrawal and consumption in the secondary industry. In addition to the
   large quantities, another important feature of energy-water use in China
   is a critical spatial mismatch between water consumption and water
   availability. We used a multiregional input-output model to investigate
   virtual water of the energy industry in the Chinese provinces, and to
   determine virtual water flows embedded in energy-related trade among the
   provinces. The domestic interprovincial trade of energy in China has
   caused virtual water being used outside of the energy production
   province, including 8.6\% of the virtual water withdrawal and 15.6\% of
   the virtual water consumption. The results demonstrate there are a
   general north-to-south flow and a west-to-east flow of virtual
   energy-water within China. This flowing pattern indicates the energy
   consumption in the more-developed provinces, such as Beijing, Tianjin,
   Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, are supported by water use
   from the less-developed provinces where water scarcity is severe.
   Particularly, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia are two major exporters of
   virtual energy-water because more than half of the water resources in
   these two provinces outflow mainly to the north region, imposing huge
   pressure on the scarce domestic water resources in these two provinces.
   This study has proved the great importance of and also provided an
   approach to integrating water-energy nexus into energy industry planning
   and management in China.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Integration of the food, energy, and water (FEW) nexus thinking is
   expected to enhance cross-sectoral discussion during the process of
   policy development. This process can be improved with comprehensive
   assessment tools to provide quantitative information regarding the
   interdependence of the FEW nexus. A comprehensive framework of the
   regional FEW nexus quantitative assessment was proposed in this study.
   Life cycle assessment (LCA) was the core method used to evaluate the FEW
   inter-linkages. Land use data which can further imply the resources
   consumption or requirement was introduced to estimate potential changes
   in the nexus in future time periods. In order to display the
   practicality of the FEW nexus approach, a user-friendly nexus platform,
   a GIS-based Regional Environmental Assessment Tool for Food-Energy-Water
   nexus (GREAT for FEW) (http://greatforfew.enve.ntu.edu.tw/FEW/), was
   developed with a solid conceptual model, a database, and calculation
   methods. The usability of the tool was demonstrated using a Taiwanese
   case study. The results of the Taiwanese case showed that Scenario 1
   (non-nuclear homeland policy) caused the lowest environmental impacts as
   compared to both Scenario 0 (baseline) and Scenario 2 (non-nuclear
   homeland policy with National Spatial Plan) due to better energy
   structures and maintenance of agricultural lands. These outcomes
   indicate that the selection of indicators does affect the results.
   Therefore, it is suggested that additional indicators should be designed
   based on the characteristics of the case study area and concerns of
   stakeholders.}},

Abstract = {{An irrigation scheme is implemented in the Weather Research and
   Forecasting (WRF) model to investigate irrigation impacts over the
   Continental U.S. (CONUS). Four major irrigated regions and two downwind
   regions were chosen to understand irrigation impacts over different
   climate regimes with a focus on irrigation-induced changes on the water
   and energy cycles. The Dynamic Recycling Model (DRM) is employed to
   quantify precipitation induced by irrigation and the precipitation
   recycling ratios over each irrigated region. With the irrigation scheme,
   WRF improves the simulated precipitation, surface skin temperature, and
   energy fluxes compared to reference datasets. For the energy cycle,
   irrigation increases latent heat flux over the irrigated regions along
   with reduced sensible heat flux. The evaporative cooling effect induced
   by irrigation leads to a cooler surface and less outgoing longwave
   radiation at the surface. Irrigation also intensifies the hydrological
   cycle over the irrigated regions, reflected by the increased
   precipitation, evapotranspiration, recycling ratio, and moisture export.
   Downwind regions exhibit increased precipitation and evaporation,
   decreased moisture flux divergence, and less consistent variations in
   recycling ratio. The precipitation increases over the irrigated regions
   can be partly explained by the more unstable low-level conditions, while
   reduced net moisture export is coincident with the precipitation
   increases over the downwind regions.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change has affected rainfall patterns in tropical regions, where
   simultaneous demands for water and energy, habitat loss, declining
   biodiversity, and spread of invasive species have reflected a rapidly
   changing world underway. In Brazil, hydropower generation accounts for
   64\% of the electricity matrix, which presently includes 1007 small
   hydropower plants (SHPs) having many others under construction or
   planned. This paper aimed to evaluate changes in water quality, plankton
   communities, and benthic macroinvertebrates during dam construction,
   filling, and the first year of operation of a SHP. Suspended solids,
   turbidity, and silica were variables that highlighted the impact of this
   construction on the river. Fast changes in water quality (increases in
   calcium, chlorides, and nitrate) and on aquatic communities (i.e.
   euglenophyceans and testate amoebae increased in numbers) were detected
   during the filling phase. Following SHP construction, the concentrations
   of metals and total phosphorus tended to decrease. Two striking findings
   observed in the aquatic communities from the riverine conditions to the
   new lake were the increase in picocyanobacteria abundance, expanding
   population stocks throughout the river basin, and the constant presence
   of the invasive mollusc Corbicula fluminea in the macroinvertebrate
   assemblage, revealing once again its resistance to environmental
   variability. The lake soon became a natural trap for ions from the
   drainage basin, as revealed by the increase in electrical conductivity,
   ammonium, potassium, and magnesium concentrations and the abundance of
   cyanobacteria, highlighting the need for watershed management to improve
   ecological conditions in the lake.}},

Abstract = {{Faults in the rock mass of dam foundation are crucial in controlling dam
   deformation and stability. In particular, long-term stability of dam
   foundation is an important factor for the safety of dam operations. The
   rock in the foundation of Dagangshan hydropower station is mostly
   granite, and there are many diabase dikes distributed in granite.
   Geological survey indicates that many faults exist along the interfaces
   between granite and diabase. Lots of diabase were metamorphosed to
   chlorites, which have very low strength. In order to investigate the
   deformation of faults in diabase dikes under long-term loading, in situ
   shear creep tests were performed to estimate the creep performance of a
   fault. The shear creep displacement and the influence of displacement
   history of the specimen during multi-level loading tests were measured
   and analyzed. The isochronous stress-strain method was used to determine
   the long-term strength of the fault in shear creep tests. Considering
   the instantaneous damage and strain softening, a new
   viscoelastic-plastic softening creep model was proposed to describe the
   shear creep behavior of the fault. Comparisons confirmed that this creep
   model is capable of describing the shear creep behavior of the fault and
   the creep parameters were estimated accordingly using this model.}},

Abstract = {{In data-scarce regions, seasonal hydropower planning is hindered by the
   unavailability of reliable long-term streamflow observations, which are
   required for the construction of inflow scenario trees. In this study,
   we develop a methodological framework to overcome the problem of
   streamflow data scarcity by combining precipitation forecasts from
   ensemble numerical weather prediction models, spatially distributed
   hydrologic models, and stochastic programming. We use evapotranspiration
   as a proxy for streamflow in generating reliable reservoir inflow
   forecasts. Using the framework, we compare three different formulations
   of inflow scenario structures and their applicability to data-scarce
   regions: (1) a single deterministic forecast, (2) a scenario fan with
   the first stage deterministic, and (3) a scenario fan with all stages
   stochastic. We apply the framework to a cascade of two reservoirs in the
   Omo-Gibe River basin in Ethiopia. Future reservoir inflows are generated
   using a 3-model 30-member ensemble seasonal precipitation forecast from
   the North American Multimodel Ensemble and the Noah-MP hydrologic model.
   We then perform deterministic and stochastic optimization for hydropower
   operation and planning. Comparing the results from the three different
   inflow scenario structures, we observe that the uncertainty in reservoir
   inflows is significant only for the dry stages of the planning horizon.
   In addition, we find that the impact of model parameter uncertainty on
   hydropower production is significant (0.14-0.18x10(6) MWh).}},

   Perspective of Government Supervision}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Power grid investment behavior (PGIB) is a necessary prerequisite to
   ensure safe and reliable power supply. The supervision of PGIB is an
   important measure to reduce electricity price. It helps to release the
   dividends of the new power system reform and promote the sustainable
   development of the power industry. However, for a long time, China's
   regulation of PGIB was relatively weak, lacking clear supervision
   awareness and effective supervision methods. On the basis of clarifying
   the contents of PGIB supervision, this paper establishes an evaluation
   index system for the compliance of PGIB from the government supervision
   perspective, involving four dimensions and 14 secondary indicators.
   Furthermore, a hybrid evaluation model based on the combined
   decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method (DEMATEL-ANP),
   analytical network process method, and vague set is proposed. The
   results reveal that the control over cost and efficiency of the PGIB in
   China is not enough. According to the results, this paper puts forward
   the indicators that close attention should be paid to and the work
   priorities in China's supervision of PGIB, which has certain practical

Abstract = {{A simulation-optimization model (ADINA-MMRDE) has been developed using
   the commercial finite-element software ADINA coupled with an improved
   differential evolution algorithm (MMRDE) to estimate the hydraulic
   conductivity of the aquifer of the Lu Dila hydropower project in China.
   The ADINA-MMRDE model employed the sum of the weighted square difference
   between the simulated value and the observed value as the objective
   function. To evaluate the accuracy of the MMRDE, the ADINA software was
   also coupled with a classical differential evolution (DE) algorithm and
   particle swarm optimization (PSO). Before estimating the initial seepage
   field of the Lu Dila hydropower station, the performance of the
   ADINA-MMRDE model was first tested using a boundary-simplified model
   based on the initial seepage field model. The effects of different
   objective functions, measurement errors and population sizes on the
   performance of ADINA-MMRDE were investigated. Then the ADINA-MMRDE model
   was applied to the Lu Dila hydropower project by considering water
   levels in 20 boreholes. The results showed that the head calculated
   using the estimated parameters was very close to its observed value. The
   water levels of 13 monitoring boreholes were used for further
   confirmation of the parameters obtained by the inversion. The results
   revealed that the calculated values of the monitoring borehole water
   levels were generally well fitted to the measured values. This study
   demonstrated the effectiveness of the ADINA-MMRDE model for practical

Abstract = {{Increasing human demands for water, energy, food and materials, are
   expected to accentuate resource supply challenges over the coming
   decades. Experience suggests that long-term strategies for a single
   sector could yield both trade-offs and synergies for other sectors.
   Thus, long-term transition pathways for linked resource systems should
   be informed using nexus approaches. Global integrated assessment models
   can represent the synergies and trade-offs inherent in the exploitation
   of water, energy and land (WEL) resources, including the impacts of
   international trade and climate policies. In this study, we review the
   current state-of-the-science in global integrated assessment modeling
   with an emphasis on how models have incorporated integrated WEL
   solutions. A large-scale assessment of the relevant literature was
   performed using online databases and structured keyword search queries.
   The results point to the following main opportunities for future
   research and model development: (1) improving the temporal and spatial
   resolution of economic models for the energy and water sectors; (2)
   balancing energy and land requirements across sectors; (3) integrated
   representation of the role of distribution infrastructure in alleviating
   resource challenges; (4) modeling of solution impacts on downstream
   environmental quality; (5) improved representation of the implementation
   challenges stemming from regional financial and institutional capacity;
   (6) enabling dynamic multi-sectoral vulnerability and adaptation needs
   assessment; and (7) the development of fully-coupled assessment
   frameworks based on consistent, scalable, and regionally-transferable
   platforms. Improved database management and computational power are
   needed to address many of these modeling challenges at a global-scale.}},

Abstract = {{Policymaking in the water-energy-food nexus is characterized by complex
   ecological, social, and economic interdependencies. Nexus research
   assumes these interactions to be overseen in the respective resource
   governance resulting in sectoral perspectives contributing to
   unsustainable outcomes. In Germany, the political priority given to the
   formation of an internationally competitive livestock sector by means of
   intensification, specialization and regional concentration has exerted
   sustained pressure on water and soil resources. The expansion of
   bioenergy plants promoted by the renewable energy act has exacerbated
   the situation. Despite the persistency of the ecological challenges,
   German policymakers only reacted when the European Commission referred
   Germany to the European Court of Justice. Current policy efforts to

Abstract = {{The construction of hydropower stations is not without controversy as
   they have a certain degree of impact on the ecological environment.
   Moreover, the water footprint and its cumulative effects on the
   environment (The relationship between the degree of hydropower
   development and utilization in the basin and the environment) of the
   development and utilization of cascade hydropower stations are
   incompletely understood. In this paper, we calculate the evaporated
   water footprint (EWF, water evaporated from reservoirs) and the product
   water footprint of hydropower stations (PWF, water consumption per unit
   of electricity production), and the blue water scarcity (BWS, the ratio
   of the total blue water footprint to blue water availability) based on
   data from 19 selected hydropower stations in the Yalong River Basin,
   China. Results show that: (a) the EWFs in established, ongoing,
   proposed, and planning phases of 19 hydropower stations are 243, 123,
   59, and 42 Mm(3), respectively; (b) the PWF of 19 hydropower stations
   varies between 0.01 and 4.49 m(3)GJ(-1), and the average PWF is 1.20
   m(3)GJ(-1). These values are quite small when compared with hydropower
   stations in other basins in the world, and the difference in PWF among
   different hydropower stations is mainly derived from energy efficiency
   factor; (c) all the BWS in the Yalong River Basin are below 100\% (low
   blue water scarcity), in which the total blue water footprint is less
   than 20\% of the natural flow, and environmental flow requirements are
   met. From the perspective of the water footprint method, the cumulative
   environmental effects of hydropower development and utilization in the
   Yalong River Basin will not affect the local environmental flow

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{134}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Interconnected regional electricity markets are often subject to
   asymmetric carbon policies with partial coverage for CO2 emissions.
   While the resulting problem of carbon leakage has been well studied, its
   mitigation has received relatively less attention. We devise a proactive
   carbon policy via a bi-level modelling approach by considering the
   impact of an emission cap that limits the cost of damage from a regional
   power market. In particular, a welfare-maximising policymaker sets the
   cap when facing profit-maximising producers and the damage costs from
   their emissions at two nodes. A partial-coverage policy could degrade
   maximised social welfare and increase total regional CO2 emissions with
   potential for carbon leakage due to a higher nodal price difference. A
   modified carbon policy that considers CO2 emissions from both nodes
   tightens the cap, which increases maximised social welfare and decreases
   total CO2 emissions vis-a-vis the partial-coverage policy, albeit at the
   cost of greater scope for carbon leakage as it causes nodal prices to
   diverge. As a compromise, an import-coverage policy, implemented by
   California, that counts only domestic and imported CO2 emissions could
   alleviate carbon leakage at the cost of lower maximised social welfare
   with higher total emissions vis-a-vis the modified-coverage policy.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{186}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the main impacts of high penetration levels of wind
   power in the power system of Southern Brazil. For this, an hourly
   operation of the Brazilian Southern power system is simulated using an
   Economic Dispatch Model. Two main scenarios are explored: a baseline and
   a wind penetration case, both for 2030 and 2050. To create these
   scenarios, results from an Integrated Energy Model are used as inputs
   for the dispatch model. The economic dispatch modeling led to some
   expected outcomes, such as a reduction in the system generation cost, a
   reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions, and a greater need for
   transmission expansion in the wind-power scenarios. Results also show
   that, even for a power system as flexible as the one in Southern Brazil,
   wind power penetration impacts can be observed. Moreover, results show
   that setting thermal power plants to provide secondary reserve can
   potentially improve the balancing management in hydropower-based
   systems. Finally, results from linking the Economic Dispatch Model and
   the Integrated Energy Model showed the need for better combining energy
   expansion models with power dispatch models that consider both the
   operation and the transmission system restrictions, in order to have
   stable and feasible unit commitment schedules. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Experimental investigation of theoretical stability regions for
   ultra-low frequency oscillations of hydropower generating systems}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{186}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{With the increasing momentum towards flexible power systems based on
   renewables, the role of hydropower has great importance, especially for
   providing balancing power. In this paper, a fundamental study on the
   operating stability of hydropower generating systems is conducted to
   reveal the practical characteristics for the newly emergent issue of
   ultra-low frequency oscillations. A unique study methodology is adapted
   by combing the theoretical analysis and the physical model experiment.
   In this paper, first, the set-up of the integral experiment platform for
   the transient processes of the pumped storage plants is presented.
   Second, a mathematical model of hydropower generating systems is built,
   and the theoretical stability analysis is conducted based on the
   Routh-Hurwitz criterion and the stability margin region. The model
   experiments related to the frequency stability of hydropower generating
   systems were conducted with reference to the stability region from
   theoretical analysis. The results demonstrate the sustained ultra-low
   frequency oscillations and frequency instability of hydropower units in
   experiments for the first time. Attenuation characteristics of the
   oscillations are theoretically derived based on the stability margin
   region, and then quantitatively identified by experiments. The
   experiment accorded with theoretical stability region within a
   reasonable tolerance that corresponded to the +/- 0.1 stability margin.

Title = {{Defining water-related energy for global comparison, clearer
   communication, and sharper policy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{236}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The need for energy in water provision and use is obvious, however the
   drivers are often complex, difficult to assess, and often inconsistently
   presented. Here we build a clearer definition and conceptual framework
   of ``water-related energy{''}. We apply this framework to harmonise data
   and results across disparate studies so that regional estimates of
   water-related energy can be compared in a consistent way for the first
   time. We show how widely different boundaries have been used for
   analysis including or excluding: water and wastewater utilities, as well
   as residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural water users.
   Consequently, understanding of what constitutes ``water-related
   energy{''} is widely divergent. We demonstrate how up to 12.6\% of total
   national primary energy use can be influenced by water, when (i)
   water-related energy of water users, and (ii) energy use by water
   utilities, are all included. Water heating for residential, commercial,
   and industrial purposes is the dominant fraction. Water and wastewater
   utilities use 0.4-2.3\% of primary energy or 0.6-6.2\% of regional
   electricity, mostly for water pumping. This is substantial, but lower
   than frequent claims in the media and reports. To answer how is
   miscommunication influencing policy? we undertake a novel systematic
   tracking of communication to demonstrate distortion between research and
   its application in government reports, media and policy. We show that
   significant confusion is caused by (i) unclear or inconsistent
   boundaries (ii) widely differing use of terms for water ``system{''},
   ``sector{''}, and ``supply{''}, (iii) frequent failure to distinguish
   `energy' from `electricity' and (iv) wide use of non-standard units.
   While acknowledging that media is often less accurate than government
   reports, and that peer-reviewed articles generally have highest overall
   quality, we observe miscommunication and inconsistency in all
   publication forms. We argue a global protocol is needed to improve
   consistency of analysis and sharpen policy towards sustainable water end
   use because this is where most water-related energy occurs. We establish
   a foundational framework and definitions for this protocol while
   recognising much more needs to be done. The strong practical and
   theoretical implications of the work for sustainable cleaner production
   are elucidated. This is timely, as global quantification of
   water-related energy has yet to occur particularly for water end-use
   which is the dominant component. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{China has experienced an unprecedented increase in hydropower
   development with the implementation of the `West-East Electricity
   Transfer' project. Its total hydropower capacity has reached 350 GW, of
   which nearly one-third is transmitted to the load centre through an
   ultra-high-voltage power network. However, the absorption of abundant
   hydropower in southwest China is still a challenge, with increasing
   hydropower curtailment each year. This study provides an overview of the
   evolution of hydropower absorption, analyses the major problems and
   possible causes, and suggests several technical solutions. It is
   suggested to optimise the generation operations with power network
   limitations and transmission schedules to make full use of transmission
   channels and improve operational flexibility. Meanwhile, receiving power
   grids should coordinate the operations between southwestern hydropower
   and their local plants, and hydropower allocation among subordinate
   power grids. The differences in operation characteristics, regulation
   ability, and load demands will be helpful for efficiently absorbing
   large-scale outer hydropower. Reasonable economic incentives and
   compensation mechanisms are considered as another method to alleviate
   hydropower curtailment. Ancillary service market and discrepant
   electricity prices during different receivers and different periods are
   suggested. The overall analysis results indicate that there is great
   space for promoting hydropower absorption under existing transmission
   channel conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Water and energy circulate between provinces and sectors through
   products and services. The multi-scale input-output method can quantify
   the resources embodied in direct consumption, domestic trade and foreign
   trade and the resources in intermediate input and final consumption. In
   this study, this method is used to calculate the embodied water
   intensity and embodied energy intensity at the provincial level in
   China. The impacts of interprovincial water and energy transfers on
   provincial water stress were analyzed with reference to their water
   stress index. The results show that direct consumption is the main
   component of the embodied water intensity, with an average proportion of
   52.21\%. However, differences among provinces are significant, ranging
   from 14.82 to 80.11\%. The embodied energy intensity is mainly reflected
   in domestic imports, with a national average of 61.01\%. Domestic
   exports (3.69 x 10(11) m(3)), urban household consumption (2.01 x 10(11)
   m(3)), and gross fixed capital formation (1.49 x 10(11) m(3)) share the
   largest proportion of final consumption, and they are also the main
   components in the final consumption of energy. Provincial water and
   energy transfers do not play major roles in relieving water stress in
   the net inflow areas but increase water stress in the net outflow areas.
   Provinces with high embodied water intensity and energy-induced water
   intensity tend to transfer more water to other provinces, while
   provinces with low intensity receive more supplies from other areas.
   Therefore, it is important to focus on improving the water use
   efficiency in provinces with active trade and high water and energy
   intensities, pay more attention to the demand side and avoid the
   continuous expansion of indirect consumption due to excessive
   restrictions on direct consumption.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{The development of renewable energy technologies in the Arctic faces
   technical barriers mainly related to extremely cold temperature.
   Moreover, storage issues to bridge the gap between supply and demand are
   more compelling than in temperate climates. Can underground thermal
   energy storage be efficiently used in such a cold environment to offer a
   viable seasonal storage alternative? This working hypothesis was tested
   by designing and simulating for the first time a borehole thermal energy
   storage facility in a subarctic climate. A system comprising a 1000 m(2)
   gross solar area and one hundred 30-m-deep borehole heat exchangers was
   simulated in TRNSYS to cover part of the heating demand of a pumping
   station that supplies drinking water in Kuujjuaq (Northern Quebec,
   Canada). The Nunavik capital is characterized by more than 8000 heating
   degree days below 18 degrees C and average spring-summer solar radiation
   of 4.6 kWh m(-2) d(-1). Despite the presence of discontinuous scattered
   permafrost in the area, the study site is free of frozen ground, likely
   due to a talik that developed around a nearby lake. A number of
   scenarios reveal that solar fraction of 45 to 50\% and heat recovery of
   more than 60\% can be achieved by the 3rd year of operation, resulting
   in annual savings of 7000 l of regular diesel consumption. A 50-years
   life-cycle cost analysis demonstrates that a specific incentive program
   can guarantee similar net present cost and levelized cost of energy
   compared to the current diesel-dependent situation, or better if
   electricity comes from renewable source. An additional 10\% loss of
   thermal energy occurs when groundwater advection is a factor. FEFLOW
   simulations demonstrate that square-shaped storage together with a
   newly-proposed borehole connection design can reduce advection heat loss
   by 60\% and improve the overall performance of the system. This work
   validates the technical viability of underground thermal energy storage
   in subarctic climates and indicates it could help reduce fossil fuel
   consumption in remote arctic regions across the world. Moreover, the
   novel type of borehole connection designed for this study can be useful
   in seasonal storage systems facing low heat recovery due to groundwater
   flow, regardless of climate.}},

   kW(p) PV arrays, two diesel generators with a rated power of 1250 kW,
   600 batteries, and a 500 kW sized converter provides the lowest total
   net present cost of \$8,162,822 and a levelized cost of energy of 0.480
   \$/kWh with a renewable fraction of 57\%. In addition, it is found that
   the hybrid PV/diesel/battery system can significantly reduce the
   emission of pollutants over its lifetime compared to other feasible
   systems, particularly diesel generator-only systems. The hybrid
   PV/diesel/battery system is therefore a good alternative energy schemes

Abstract = {{This article investigates the energy intensity and related impacts of

   transfer 15.5 billion m(3) water driven by a large-scale system of
   pumping stations. This energy production required 7.4 million m(3) of

Abstract = {{The lack of safe drinking water and electricity in rural areas of
   Sub-Saharan Africa is extremely alarming and, together with progressing
   climate change and political conflicts, increasingly impairing economic
   development. Only robust technologies of autonomous water treatment
   systems driven by solar electricity based on sustainable economic
   concepts can provide clean water and electricity at affordable prices.
   Technologies for water cleaning combined with off-grid electrification
   are analyzed for their suitability under different conditions,
   exemplified for Nigeria, and economically feasible concepts are
   developed for different target groups: (i) single-farmer concept
   providing electricity from PV, UV-treated drinking water and irrigation
   water, and generating income from selling increased crop yields; (ii)
   farmer cooperative; (iii) community concept, with additional income
   generation from selling water and electricity; and (iv) rural kiosk
   concept selling electricity and water, and offering further goods and
   services. In the latter three concepts, high quantities of drinking
   water and electricity are supplied by an autonomous, PV-driven water
   cleaning system with disinfection based on anodic oxidation and in situ
   chlorine production. Only if economically sustainable can drinking water
   and electricity supply be achieved at a global level, and the UN
   sustainable development goals be reached. In the framework of a rural
   community concept, a pilot project starts in Abuja/Nigeria based on the
   anodic oxidation system for water treatment with an intelligent payment

Abstract = {{Energy, water and carbon flows are highly intertwined in economy and
   influence urban and regional sustainability. Few insights have been
   acquired for energy-water-carbon nexus at inter-regional scale
   considering both in- and trans-boundary flows. Here we propose an
   interactive framework to assess inter-regional energy-water-carbon
   nexus, encapsulating both direct nexus flows within territory and nexus
   flows embodied in final consumption. An inter-regional input-output
   model is established to account for energy-related water footprint,
   water-related energy footprint and water-related carbon footprint from a
   consumption-based perspective. Using Guangdong-Hong Kong as a case
   study, we find that though these nexus footprints contribute a small
   fraction of the total energy, water and carbon footprints of both
   regions in 2012, their impacts should not be neglected due to higher
   intensities. The direct intensities of water-related energy and
   water-related carbon are more than 2 times higher than the total energy
   and carbon intensities, while their embodied intensities are over 6
   times higher. Inter-regional trade plays an important role in
   controlling energy-water-carbon nexus of both sides. About 29-44\% of
   the consumption-based nexus footprints of Hong Kong's consumption are
   outsourced to Guangdong and other regions, while 21-24\% of Guangdong's
   footprints are from production elsewhere. These are strong signals
   showing the importance of managing energy-water-carbon nexus on a
   cross-border and fully-interactive basis.}},

   developer. The task of efficiency testing and performance evaluation of
   shp plants was assigned by MNRE to Alternate hydro Energy Centre (AHEC)
   Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee in the year 2003 along with
   financial support to acquire the required instrumentation and develop
   expertise. Over 200 small hydro plants (SHPs) of different capacity
   (1-25 MW) as well as types viz dam toe based, run of river and canal
   fall based have been tested for efficiency and performance evaluation
   during the period 2005-2018 in different states of India as per
   IEC-60041, IEC-62006, ISO -1438-1 and ISO-748 to the extend feasible as
   per available resources and time. During efficiency testing of hydro
   plants, it has been found that discharge measurement is very challenging
   activity as the most of the plant owners did not provide the required
   space and provisions for mounting/fixing the instruments for discharge
   measurement. After commissioning of the plants it becomes extremely
   difficult to select the ideal/suitable locations and providing the
   provisions for mounting different measuring instruments. Various
   problems observed during discharge measurement are discussed in this
   paper and may be helpful for testing in future.}},

Abstract = {{It is of great significance to deal with the relationship between
   external factors and the water-energy-food internal system for China's
   sustainable development. This paper takes China as the research object,
   uses the system dynamics method to construct a model for China's
   water-energy-food system, and introduces the ``two-child{''} policy and
   trade friction as the scenario parameters for simulation. The main
   results of scenario simulation can be summarized as the following three
   points. In terms of water, the trade friction will hinder China's
   industrial water consumption into a low-consumption stage. In terms of
   energy, both the trade friction and the ``two-child{''} policy, will not
   change the increasing trend of energy demand. In terms of food, if there
   is strong response to the ``two-child{''} policy, there will be
   insufficient food inventory under the current capacity and import ratio.
   In short, this paper takes the sustainable development of
   water-energy-food as a starting point and puts forward policy
   suggestions on the comprehensive formulation of policies.}},

   moderate in 2006-2012 and high in 2012-2015. The indexes, which
   represent water-use efficiency and yield per unit area of crops, had
   higher sensitivities in the context of the present case study. The
   results also indicated that agricultural sustainability had a
   comparatively positive trend between 2012 and 2015, and that pesticide

Abstract = {{The food-energy-water (FEW) nexus is, by definition, a ``wicked

Abstract = {{Strategies for managing water stress negotiate a complex series of
   trade-offs and opportunities. Game-changing opportunities for water
   stressed regions are emerging with new emissions reduction strategies
   and energy options. These have particular significance for
   socio-economic development pathways in the marginal drought-prone
   regions. In this paper, we explore the energy-water-environment nexus in
   watersheds undergoing acute water stress and energy transitions in the
   Arab region and the Horn of Africa. A review of published and ongoing
   scientific activity was used to elaborate four case studies and identify
   common trade-offs between objectives to reduce water stress, increase
   productivity and lower energy costs and emissions. The available
   scientific evidence base for assessment of these trade-offs was then
   compared via a discursive process amongst review team members.
   Collectively, the case studies present a state of the art in available
   geoscientific methods currently applied in the Arab region to quantify
   nexus trade-offs for decision-making concerning increasing groundwater
   use, water harvesting and wastewater reuse across the case studies. The
   review pursues the wider geographic relevance and scope of this emerging
   scientific agenda. It identifies global opportunities to boost and
   progressively enhance the geoscientific information bases for
   decision-making in the most water stressed regions, as well as direct
   comparisons with emerging discussion in the Horn of Africa region.
   Insights for sustainable development decision-makers are highlighted and
   further scope for the transfer of insights within and beyond the Arab

Abstract = {{In recent years, the development of pumped-storage hydroelectricity has
   seen a very rapid increase, and lots of stations have been proposed to
   be built in China to adjust the energy structure of production and
   alleviate electrical energy shortages. The site of pumped-storage
   hydroelectric power plants is usually chosen in the mountain area, which
   can conveniently provide headwaters and height difference for the proper
   functioning of hydroelectric power station; however, geological
   disasters such as debris frequently flows in the mountain areas, posing
   great threat to the safety of plants and staff. A large pumped-storage
   hydroelectric power station will be built in the Taihang Mountains in
   the northwest of Yi County, Hebei province. To predict the potential
   scale of debris flow hazard, the shallow-water model based on the finite
   volume method (SFLOW model) is used. During the work, reconnaissance,
   geomorphological analysis, and laboratory experiment are carried out for
   model construction and data input. Then the debris flow designed for
   20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-year return periods and the flood caused by dam
   break are simulated. The simulation study shows that the potential
   debris flow hazard will greatly harm the reservoir area, and if debris
   flows destroy the dam, floods could affect the residents of a maximum of
   1.21 million square meters downstream. To prevent debris flows,
   retaining walls in the SFLOW model are set, and the results show that
   they can effectively reduce the hazard area of debris flow, ensuring the
   safety of the reservoir area. In general, the SFLOW model can accurately
   and efficiently solve the problem of fluid flow on irregular terrain and
   can be applied to similar engineering projects.}},

Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{646-656}},

Abstract = {{As Europe moves towards renewable energy, hydropower stands out as a
   renewable technology that can provide supply side flexibility through
   dispatchable electricity production. Several studies have investigated
   the flexibility hydropower can provide with a particular focus on the
   Nordic hydropower resources. Of all European countries, Norway has the
   largest hydropower resources and storage capacity. However, Norway also
   has a highly electrified heating sector, which means high electricity
   demand during winter when reservoirs are low. This paper uses EnergyPLAN
   to analyse how a shift from individual electric heating to district
   heating affects the flexibility the Norwegian energy system can provide
   to Europe. The analysis develops a 2015 reference scenario and two
   scenarios that introduce district heating based on biomass and heat
   pumps, respectively. Results show that district heating can decrease the
   maximum load on dammed hydropower facilities, thus freeing up capacity
   for potential export. Furthermore, the dammed hydropower facilities are
   able to balance the electricity demands in all hours of the year.
   However, the shift to district heating also increases forced export to
   drain reservoirs as domestic electricity demand is reduced. Also, the
   amount of import the system is able to handle is decreased under the
   modelled conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells produce a large amount of
   waste heat while generating electricity through electrochemical
   reactions, making them suitable for driving combined heating and power
   (CHP) systems. According to the hourly thermal and electric loads in a
   typical North China household, a 2-kW PEM fuel cell-based micro-CHP
   system with a lithium-ion battery energy storage system is proposed in
   this paper. The thermal and economic performances of the micro-CHP
   system with a lithium-ion battery (CHPWB) and a CHP system without a
   lithium-ion battery (CHPWOB) are comparatively analyzed by developing a
   thermal and economic performance analysis model on the MATLAB/Simulink
   platform. The thermal-load-following strategy is adopted during the
   design and simulation process. The results indicate that the storage
   capacity of the lithium-ion battery decreases by 6.6\% after one cycle.
   The lithium-ion battery can be charged by the fuel cell stack during
   off-peak hours or using commercial electricity, and the charging cycle
   of the system is one week long. The average total efficiency of the
   CHPWB system can reach 81.24\% with considering the energy loss in each
   conversion process, which is 11.02\% higher than that of the CHPWOB
   system. The daily hydrogen consumption of the CHPWB system can be
   reduced by 14.47\% compared with the CHPWOB system under the same
   operating conditions, and the average daily costs can be reduced by
   8.4\% and 9.5\% when the lifespan is 10 and 15 years, respectively. (C)

Abstract = {{We present a network model of the United States (U.S.) interstate food
   transfers to analyze the trade dependency with respect to participating
   regions and embodied irrigation impacts from a food-energy-water (FEW)
   nexus perspective. To this end, we utilize systems analysis methods
   including the pointwise mutual information (PMI) measure to provide an
   indication of interdependencies by estimating probability of trade
   between states. PMI compares observed trade with a benchmark of what is
   statistically expected given the structure and flow in the network. This
   helps assess whether dependencies arising from empirically observed
   trade occur due to chance or preferential attachment. The implications
   of PMI values are demonstrated by using Texas as an example, the largest
   importer in the U.S. grain transfer network. We find that strong
   dependencies exist not only just with states (Kansas, Oklahoma,
   Nebraska) providing high volume of transfer to Texas but also with
   states that have comparatively lower trade (New Mexico). This is due to
   New Mexico's reliance on Texas as an important revenue source compared
   to its other connections. For Texas, import interdependencies arise from
   geographical proximity to trade. As these states primarily rely on the
   commonly shared High Plains aquifer for irrigation, overreliance poses a
   risk for water shortage for food supply in Texas. PMI values also
   indicate the capacity to trade more (the states are less reliant on each
   other than expected), and therefore provide an indication of where the
   trade could be shifted to avoid groundwater scarcity. However, some of
   the identified states rely on GHG emission intensive fossil fuels such
   as diesel and gasoline for irrigation, highlighting a potential tradeoff
   between crop water footprint and switching to lower emissions pumping
   fuels.}},

Abstract = {{Hydropower is the widely used source of clean energy which includes some
   hazardous emissions that affect human health, ecosystems, and resources.
   However, in spite of an enormous amount of hydropower generation in
   Europe, no research has been carried out in evaluating the hazardous
   emissions from the plants located in alpine and non-alpine areas.
   Therefore, this paper will analyse the comparative environmental impacts
   of hydropower plants in alpine and non-alpine areas of Europe by a
   systematic life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The impacts are
   estimated by the ReCiPe 2016, Impact 2002 +, Eco-points 97 methods under
   a number of effect-assessing indicators such as global warming, ozone
   formation, eco-toxicity, water consumption, acidification,
   eutrophication, ionizing radiation, carcinogenic radiation, ozone
   depletion, and land use. Moreover, the fossil fuel -based power
   consumptions and the greenhouse-gas emissions in the life-cycle of
   hydropower plants in both locations are estimated using the Cumulative
   Energy Demand (CED) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC) methods, respectively. The outcomes reveal that hydropower plants
   of alpine regions offer a better environmental profile for the
   global-warming indicator (2.97 x 10(-5) kg CO2-eq/MJ) than non-alpine
   plants (3.92 x 10(-4) kg CO2-eq/MJ), but the effects are nearly
   identical for the other indicators. Overall, the hydropower plants of
   non-alpine regions are responsible for climate change with a rate 10
   times as high as for alpine ones. The findings of this research will
   play a pivotal role in promoting sustainable production of hydropower,
   especially the full potentials of the alpine region, and thus leading
   towards environmentally friendly clean renewable electricity generation.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decades, the nine major energy bases in north and west China
   produced increasing amounts of coal and coal-fired power to meet rapidly
   growing energy demand. However, the poor water resources condition has
   become a bottleneck for sustainable development. In this study, the
   water footprint of coal and power production is evaluated, and the flow
   of virtual water arising from the transport of energy products is
   quantified. The results show that total coal and power production
   increased continuously from 2006 to 2015. The annual total water
   footprint was as much as 1.29 billion m(3); it showed an initially
   increasing trend that peaked in 2013, after which it decreased. After
   2013, the water footprint decreased primarily as a result of
   improvements in water-saving technologies. The results also indicate
   that increasing amounts of virtual water (as much as 0.87 billion m(3)
   in 2015) embedded in energy products flowed from the north and west
   water deficient areas to the southeast water rich areas of China,
   causing severe water scarcity in the major energy producing regions.
   Unfortunately, based on our estimates, water stress will continuously
   increase during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020). This study
   finds that water-saving measures alone are not sufficient to relieve the
   water shortage and to guarantee water security. Comprehensive
   countermeasures, including an adjustment to the industrial structure,
   the physical transfer of water, regulation of the virtual water trade
   and policy and planning changes, are also necessary.}},

   its annual air temperature and precipitation have increased 1.46 degrees
   C and 89.1 mm, respectively from 1982 to 2015. We find such rise in the
   air temperature and precipitation plays a positive role in the TNR's
   vegetation restoration in a sense that the vegetation dynamics show
   positive correlation with its regional air temperature and
   precipitation, while more sensitive to precipitation. We also find
   carbon sequestration of the TNR increases at the cost of greater water
   consumption through evapotranspiration since the TNSP commences. In some
   arid regions, revegetation accelerates the water deficit due to an
   excessive rate of restoring vegetation; yet, no substantial water
   imbalance occurs as a result of enhanced precipitation and water use
   efficiency during this period. Although the solar radiation increases
   with decreases in surface albedo over the last few decades, our results
   do not reveal an appreciably increasing trend in the land surface
   temperature of the TNR. This is because the improved vegetation can
   assimilate CO2 (mitigating greenhouse gas emissions) and transpire water
   by photosynthesis, thereby increasing latent heat flux and reducing the
   warming effect. This study highlights a mixed consequence of the TNSP by
   inducing both positive and negative effects on the surface water-energy
   balance over the TNR.}},

Abstract = {{Food, energy, and water (FEW) are primary resources required for human
   populations and ecosystems. Availability of the raw resources is
   essential, but equally important are the services that deliver resources
   to human populations, such as adequate access to safe drinking water,
   electricity, and sufficient food. Any failures in either resource
   availability or FEW resources-related services will have an impact on
   human health. The ability of countries to intervene and overcome the
   challenges in the FEW domain depends on governance, education, and
   economic capacities. We distinguish between FEW resources, FEW services,
   and FEW health outcomes to develop an analysis framework for evaluating
   interrelationships among these critical resources. The framework is
   applied using a data-driven approach for sub-Saharan African countries,
   a region with notable FEW insecurity challenges. The data-driven
   approach using a cross-validated stepwise regression analysis indicates
   that limited governance and socioeconomic capacity in sub-Saharan
   African countries, rather than lack of the primary resources, more
   significantly impact access to FEW services and associated health
   outcomes. The proposed framework helps develop a cohesive approach for
   evaluating FEW metrics and could be applied to other regions of the

Abstract = {{In sub-Saharan Africa, 160 million grid-connected electricity consumers
   live in countries where hydropower accounts for over 50\% of total power
   supply. A warmer climate with more frequent and intense extremes could
   result in supply reliability issues. Here, (i) a robust framework to
   highlight the interdependencies between hydropower, water availability,
   and climate change is proposed, (ii) the state-of-the art literature on
   the projected impacts of climate change on hydropower in sub-Saharan
   Africa is reviewed, and (iii) supporting evidence on past trends and
   current pathways of power mix diversification, drought incidence, and
   climate change projections is provided. We find that only few countries
   have pursued a diversification strategy away from hydropower over the
   last three decades, while others' expansion plans will reinforce the
   dependency. This will occur irrespective of the fact that some of the
   largest river basins have experienced a significant drying during the
   last century. Agreement is found on likely positive impacts of climate
   change on East Africa's hydropower potential, negative impacts in West
   and Southern Africa, and substantial uncertainty in Central Africa.
   Irrespective of the absolute change in gross technical potential, more

   Portfolio Using Multiobjective Decision Analysis}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{The development of renewable energy becomes increasingly important
   because of exhaustion of fossil energy. Hydropower is one of the most
   important ways to generate electricity from renewable energy because of
   its relatively stable output among them. However, hydropower project
   development with some inherent characteristics is highly susceptible to
   social and natural environments, which complicates the investment
   process. For this purpose, this paper proposes a feasible comprehensive
   optimization model of portfolio investment from the perspective of
   sustainable development, describing the tradeoff relationship between
   economic, social, and ecological factors. As a hybrid uncertain NP-hard
   optimization problem, there are three critical challenges: (1) achieving
   comprehensive balance between economy, society, and ecology; (2)
   identifying available multiple conflicting objectives and reasonable
   constraints; (3) analysing the hybrid uncertain environment. Therefore,
   a practical problem-oriented multiobjective decision analysis model is
   established. Then, a multiobjective adaptive particle swarm optimization
   algorithm is designed to solve the model. Finally, a case study is
   carried out to verify the practicality of the model and the
   effectiveness of the improved algorithm. The result demonstrates that
   the model can be applied as a useful decision-making tool for
   decision-makers in sustainable hydropower project development.}},

   Groundwater, precipitation, and lake water collected during four

   groundwater recharge were the key factors explaining high salinity and
   isotopic enrichment in lake water. Additionally, the Kuisheng Lake was a
   preferential area of groundwater recharge, while the Subei Lake received
   less sources from underlying aquifer due to the combined effects of low
   permeable zone and upstream groundwater captured by the production
   wells. The homogeneous isotope signatures of groundwater may be ascribed
   to the closely vertical hydraulic connectivity between the unconfined
   and the confined aquifers. Isotopically enriched groundwater pumping
   from well field probably promoted isotopic depletion in groundwater

Abstract = {{Management of hydroelectric dams is an aspect of sustainability that
   comes with resolving problems locally. The use of global indicators has
   not been a sustainable solution, thus the need for local indicators.
   Besides, current sustainability assessment tools lack the integration of
   climate, making assessments in a climate change context impossible. In
   this paper, we present management and sustainability assessment in a
   climate change context using sustainability indicators. We modeled a
   change in the climate using normal, moderate, and extreme climate
   conditions defined by Standardized Precipitation Indices (SPI) values.
   Out of 36 years analyzed, 24 years fall in the near-normal climate
   regime, and the remaining 12 years in moderate and extreme conditions,
   making near-normal climate regime the basis for managing the Taabo Dam.
   The impact of climate, techno-economic, and socio-environmental
   indicators on sustainability were investigated, and the results were
   analyzed according to scenarios. Climate adaptation shows higher
   sustainability indices than techno-economic and socio-environmental
   scenarios. Probability matrices show high and low values, respectively,
   for environmental and flooding indicators. Risk matrices, on the other
   hand, show that even with small probability values, risks still exist,
   and such small probabilities should not be taken as an absence of risk.
   The study reveals that sustainability can be improved by integrating
   climate into existing assessment methods.}},

Abstract = {{At present, no quantitative method has been developed to analyze
   province-level data of small hydropower development in China. Knowledge
   of its temporal-spatial patterns can be conducive to predicting and
   planning for its future. For this reason, the study sets out to approach
   it as two problems: Development level evaluation and spatial
   distribution. Specifically, panel data of provinces or equivalent
   administrative units were used to establish an evaluation system
   covering the fields of economy, society, eco-environment, and resources;
   an evaluation model was formulated using the entropy weight technique
   for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method and theory
   of coupling coordination; its trends were discovered by regression
   analysis; the spatial distribution model was built by clustering
   analysis and center of gravity analysis. Results indicate that, during
   the 1990-2015 period, while small hydropower developed to their
   respective steady-state levels, some gaps still exist in the general
   trend of small hydropower among provinces. The center of gravity of
   small hydropower development displayed a movement toward the Northwest.
   Based on clustering of scores in the four dimensions and coupled
   coordination, its spatial distributions can be divided into three zones:
   Highly coordinated, relatively coordinated, and uncoordinated, and its
   temporal patterns can be described as three stages: Rise with
   fluctuations, unbalanced and uncoordinated development, and steady rise.

   Enterprises under New Electricity Market Reform: Empirical Evidence
   Based on Three-Stage DEA Model}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The new round of electricity market reform in 2015 completely changed
   the profit pattern of power grid enterprises (PGEs) in China, and
   directly affected their investment plans. Under the new electricity
   market reform (NEMR), the government regulatory authority made higher
   requirements for the investment efficiency of PGEs, and the investment
   effectiveness hence became the core criterion for investment plans.
   Therefore, the PGEs are now attaching great importance to the investment
   efficiency. According to their geographical differences, this paper
   divides the Chinese provincial PGEs into three groups, namely eastern,
   central and western region enterprises. Based on the NEMR, we developed
   an evaluation system of investment efficiency for the above-mentioned
   enterprises. Moreover, this paper selects GDP per capita, electricity
   consumption in industry, and electrification rate as external
   environment variables, and conducts an empirical research on the
   investment efficiency of 31 provincial PGEs in China in 2017. The
   analysis reveals that three external environment variables have
   considerable impacts on the investment efficiency. Though the increase
   of GDP per capita and electricity consumption in industry are not
   conducive to improving investment efficiency, the advancement of
   electrification plays a positive role in its improvement. And from the
   real efficiency results, Tianjin, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Fujian have
   relatively higher investment efficiency, while Henan, Shandong, and
   Shanghai exhibit lower investment efficiency. By comparing the
   investment efficiency of PGEs in the first and third stage, conclusions
   can be drawn that in the first stage the investment efficiency of PGEs
   was overestimated, and the inefficient investments prevailed some
   provincial PGEs, which caused by low scale efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have investigated the influence of hydropower stations on
   macroinvertebrate communities, but few have clarified the influence of
   different types of hydropower stations. A total of 133 samples obtained
   from seven rivers, on which 45 hydropower stations are located, with the
   rivers distributed across four provinces (Yunnan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and
   Hubei) were investigated to study the influence of different types of
   small hydropower stations on macroinvertebrate communities. Samples were
   collected during 2011-2012. Results showed that 126 taxa of
   macroinvertebrates were collected, of which 68.3\% were insects. The
   average macroinvertebrate density and biomass were 966 +/- 112 ind/m(2)
   and 17.31 +/- 1.54 g/m(2), respectively. For dam-type hydropower
   stations, the intercepting effect of the dam was the main factor
   affecting macroinvertebrate populations, whereas the influence of
   hydrological period was nonsignificant. Macroinvertebrate taxa richness
   exhibited a gradual increase from reservoir reaches to down-dam reaches
   and then to natural reaches (4.4, 6.5, and 9.5, respectively). The
   Shannon-Wiener index showed a similar increasing trend (1.06, 1.48, and
   1.58, respectively), whereas biomass levels exhibited a decreasing trend
   (56.3, 25.2, and 6.0 g/m(2), respectively). For the diversion-type
   hydropower stations, hydrological period was the main influential
   factor, whereas the intercepting effect of the dam was nonsignificant.
   From wet to dry seasons, increases were observed in macroinvertebrate
   abundance (5.2 to 8.3), density (322.2 to 1170.5 ind/m(2)), biomass
   (24.6 to 40.1 g/m(2)), and Shannon-Wiener index (1.23 to 2.08).}},

Abstract = {{With the supply of water, energy and food facing severe challenges,
   there has been an increased recognition of the importance of studying
   the regional water-energy-food nexus. In this paper, Inner Mongolia,
   including 12 cities in China, was selected as a research case. A
   super-efficiency slack based measure (SBM) model that considered the
   undesirable outputs was adopted to calculate the regional total factor
   productivity (TFP) and the Malmquist-Luenberger index was used to
   investigate the change trend of the TFP from 2007 to 2016 based on
   understanding the water-energy-food nexus. Finally, influential factors
   of the TFP were explored by Tobit regression. The results show that the
   12 Inner Mongolia cities are divided into higher, moderate and lower
   efficiency zones. The higher efficiency zone includes Ordos, Hohhot,
   Xing'an, and Tongliao, and the lower efficiency zone includes Chifeng,
   Xilin Gol, Baynnur, Wuhai and Alxa. There is a serious difference in TFP
   between Inner Mongolia cities. During the study period, the TFP of the
   water-energy-food nexus in Inner Mongolia cities shows a rising trend,
   which is mainly driven by the growth of technical progress change.
   However, the average ML values of the lower and moderate efficiency
   zones were inferior to the higher efficiency zone in six of the ten
   years, so the difference between Inner Mongolia cities is growing.
   According to the Tobit regression, the mechanization level and degree of
   opening up have positive effects on the TFP, while enterprise scale and
   the output of the third industry have negative effects on the TFP.
   Government support does not have any significant impact on the TFP.
   Finally, suggestions were put forward to improve the TFP of the
   water-energy-food nexus in Inner Mongolia cities.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing dam removal movement in the United States, driven in
   part by environmental, safety and cost considerations. These include
   electricity-producing hydro-dams, many of which are ageing and will
   require substantial maintenance or removal over the coming decades.
   However, hydropower has been and remains an important source of energy
   for the development of the United States, presently generating about 6\%
   of the nation's electricity while providing essential grid services. As
   a potential solution to the conflict between these imperatives,
   industrial-scale photovoltaics (PVs) could be used for replacement of
   the energy foregone from hydro-dam removals either by installing the PV
   infrastructure in the area formerly inundated by the dam reservoir or
   through offsite replacement. Presently, the total PV generation in the
   conterminous United States is 35,919 GWh yr(-1), or approximately 13\%
   of hydropower generation. On the basis of actual hydropower generation
   in the conterminous United States in 2016 (that is, 274,868 GWh yr(-1)),
   we estimated that 529,885 ha of PVs would be needed to replace the
   generation of all 2,603 hydro-dams-an area approximately equal to the
   land size of Delaware. PVs could replace the total annual energy
   produced from these dams while requiring only 13\% of their existing
   reservoir area. If all the hydro-dams in the United States were removed
   and only 50\% of the emergent land was used for PVs, 945,062 GWh yr(-1)
   power could be generated, which is 3.44 times the current hydropower
   generation. These analyses are theoretical and do not consider costs,
   which would be highly site specific. Replacement by PVs without energy
   storage could not replicate the dispatchability and grid services
   provisions of existing hydropower facilities; however, improving battery
   storage capabilities may ameliorate this shortcoming. We suggest that
   PVs could replace much of the annual electricity output of hydro-dams in
   the United States while using substantially less land area and providing
   considerable environmental and ecological benefits.}},

   solar, wind power, and hydropower. In order to apply this solution in
   the real energy system, potentials for clean energy supply in an
   optimized manner should be evaluated. In this study, an optimization
   model is developed for a regional energy system in the central part of
   Sweden. The studied system consists of Combined Heat and Power (CHP)
   plants and heat water boilers together with renewable energy supply from
   rooftop Photo Voltaic (PV) - solar collectors and regional hydropower
   plants. The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is used to create
   the model based on the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method.
   The goal is to evaluate the influence of local renewable energy systems
   on the production planning of CHP plants in a region. Two different
   scenarios are investigated based on the extremes in energy supply and
   demand concerning the increased use of Electrical Vehicles (EV5) and
   more application of Heat Pumps (HPs) in the system. The results show
   that installation of rooftop PV systems has the potential to reduce the
   electricity import to the region; however, it will at the same time
   reduce the operation time of the CHP plans during the summer period.
   With increased use of HPs for heating, the shut off time for CHP plants
   is further increased. Increase in electric passenger cars penetration in
   the system has no impacts on the production profiles of the plants. The
   regional electricity demand grows significantly by more utilization of
   EVs and increased application of heat pumps in the studied system. The
   high electricity demand will mainly be satisfied by importing
   electricity from outside the region together with low production from
   CHP plants and the power generated by the rooftop PV systems and
   regional hydropower. The developed optimization model with studied
   scenarios can be applied to other energy systems to increase the
   knowledge of production planning and feasibility of a fossil fuel free
   energy system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an interval-credibility-chance constrained programming
   (ICCCP) method which is capable of handling uncertainties presented as
   interval and interval-fuzzy-random values existed in the energy water
   nexus (EWN) system is developed. An ICCCP-EWN model is formulated for
   planning energy-water nexus system of Xiamen that is heavily relies on
   fossil fuels (e.g., coal is a main energy source). A set of probability
   and credibility levels related to energy-water availabilities,
   energy-water demands, and pollutant-emission mitigations are examined.
   Results discover that uncertainties have significant effects on the
   system planning strategies. System cost, heat generation, imported
   energy, and water supply would decrease with the raised probability
   level and increase with the raised credibility level. Coal-fired would
   be the main contributor to electricity generation; however, its
   proportion would reduce from {[}59.4, 59.91\% to {[}40.5, 41.8]\%.
   Gas-fired would increase from {[}27.4, 27.6]\% to {[}41.5, 43.9]\% of
   the total electricity generation. Surface water would be the main water
   source, sharing more than 65\% of the total amount. One of the major
   water users would be gas-fired electricity generation, increasing from
   {[}32.1, 32.61\% to {[}42.1, 44.61\% in future. These findings can
   provide useful information for the study city to adjust the existing
   energy and water planning strategies to achieve the goal of sustainable

Abstract = {{For considerate use of limited freshwater resources in arid regions, it
   is very important to recycle the evapotranspiration water in greenhouse
   production for sustainable agriculture. In addition, in a typical
   greenhouse, ideal conditions for plants are set at low temperature,
   which is provided by evaporative cooling systems and ventilation, and
   this leads to more water waste. In this study, a water harvesting system
   was devised in the ventilation air path and our simulation for hot
   months showed that in a largescale greenhouse, daily 9.5 tons of water
   is directed out of the greenhouse and 3.3 tons of them can be returned
   to the system by this device. A case study in a semi-arid area (Isfahan,
   Iran) showed that this system can provide 50\% of water demand in
   summer. Such a system may provide feasible solutions for low growth
   yields in water-stressed regions and agriculture-dependent economies.

Abstract = {{About 60\% of southern Africa's population lives in rural areas with
   limited access to basic services and amenities such as clean and safe
   water, affordable and clean energy, and balanced and nutritious diets.
   Resource scarcity has direct and indirect impacts on nutrition, human
   health, and well-being of mostly poor rural communities. Climate change
   impacts in the region are manifesting through low crop yields, upsurge
   of vector borne diseases (malaria and dengue fever), and water and
   food-borne diseases (cholera and diarrhoea). This study applied a
   water-energy-food (WEF) nexus analytical livelihoods model with complex
   systems understanding to assess rural livelihoods, health, and
   well-being in southern Africa, recommending tailor-made adaptation
   strategies for the region aimed at building resilient rural communities.
   The WEF nexus is a decision support tool that improves rural livelihoods
   through integrated resource distribution, planning, and management, and
   ensures inclusive socio-economic transformation and development, and
   addresses related sustainable development goals, particularly goals 2,
   3, 6 and 7. The integrated WEF nexus index for the region was calculated
   at 0.145, which is marginally sustainable, and indicating the region's
   exposure to vulnerabilities, and reveals a major reason why the region
   fails to meet its developmental targets. The integrated relationship
   among WEF resources in southern Africa shows an imbalance and uneven
   resource allocation, utilisation and distribution, which normally
   results from a `siloed' approach in resource management. The WEF nexus
   provides better adaptation options, as it guides decision making
   processes by identifying priority areas needing intervention, enhancing
   synergies, and minimising trade-offs necessary for resilient rural
   communities. Our results identified (i) the trade-offs and unintended
   negative consequences for poor rural households' livelihoods of current
   silo approaches, (ii) mechanisms for sustainably enhancing household
   water, energy and food security, whilst (iii) providing direction for
   achieving SDGs 2, 3, 6 and 7.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable energy has gained popularity as an alternative to fossil
   fuels, which regularly emit large amounts of Greenhouse Gases and
   consume/withdraw large amounts of water, but renewable energy market
   penetration is still limited while fossil fuels are still the U.S.'s
   dominant power source. This is due to resistance in the market, or in
   this case, the failure of renewable energy policies to achieve long-term
   environmental sustainability due to neglected external factors
   (economic, societal, etc.). No available literature analyzes potential
   sources and/or effects of this policy resistance, so this research
   investigates the underlying mechanisms in the renewable energy
   generation market by utilizing a system dynamics model. A
   two-alternative Generalized Bass Model was developed to simulate the
   renewable energy market (specifically with respect to solar PV and wind
   energy), including the environmental, societal, and economic concerns
   associated with each of the alternatives evaluated in this study, so as
   to identify and address possible causes of policy resistance and its
   subsequent effects on environmental impacts (esp. GHG emissions and
   water withdrawal rates). Based on this model, three separate policy
   areas (solar PV investments, wind power investments, and the elimination
   of fossil fuel subsidies) and various combinations thereof were proposed
   and tested within the context of the model. Based on the results of this
   study, it is highly recommended to invest as generously as possible into
   multiple renewable energy industries, reduce fossil fuel subsidies (in
   turn freeing up funding for renewable energy investments), and seek
   further advancement in renewable energy technologies (e.g. enhancing the
   useable lifetimes of wind turbines). A balanced policy have potential to
   increase the share of renewable's up to roughly 40\% in the U.S. by
   2050, as well as 17\% and 32\% GHG and water withdrawal reduction
   potential by 2050. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The underground powerhouse caverns of the Lianghekou hydropower station
   are characterized by their depth, high geo-stress, and complicated
   surrounding geological conditions. To identify the excavation-induced
   damage zones and realize the deformation early warning of surrounding
   rock masses of the underground powerhouse, a high-resolution
   microseismic (MS) monitoring system was adopted to conduct real-time
   monitoring of the inner microfracture activity of the surrounding rock
   mass. The spatiotemporal evolution of the MS events recorded in the
   aggregation areas prior to the deformation of the surrounding rock mass
   was analyzed. The analysis results show that two typical MS event
   clustering zones were closely related to the blasting excavation
   disturbances of the omnibus bar caves and the working surfaces. The MS
   activity shows an obvious spatiotemporal migration evolution pattern
   controlled by excavation, which can be analyzed to provide some
   reference for future support measures. The Es/Ep value of approximately
   75\% of the MS events in one typical clustering zone was below 10, which
   indicates that the rock microfractures were dominated by non-shear
   failures. Furthermore, prior to the deformation relaxation of the
   surrounding rock mass, the MS events in the selected clustering zone
   increased and became rapidly concentrated, the apparent stress of the
   corresponding MS events suddenly decreased, and the cumulative apparent
   volume increased dramatically. This phenomenon of MS parameter
   variations can be regarded as an evaluation index of the deformation
   early warning of surrounding rock masses. The analysis results prove
   that MS monitoring is essential for the assessment and mitigation of rib
   spalling and collapse risks in deep underground caverns, and can be used
   to minimize catastrophic events involving equipment and personnel. The
   results of the current study may be valuable for future excavation
   management and safety evaluations for similar underground caverns with
   high in situ stresses.}},

Abstract = {{The development of clean energy is of great importance in alleviating
   both the energy crisis and environmental pollution resulting from rapid
   global economic growth. Hydroelectric generation is considered climate
   benign, as it neither requires fossil carbon to produce energy nor emits
   large amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG), unlike conventional energy
   generation techniques such as coal and oil power plants. However, dams
   and their associated reservoirs are not entirely GHG-neutral and their
   classification as a clean source of energy requires further
   investigation. This study evaluated the environmental impact of the
   Xiajiang hydropower station based on life cycle assessment (LCA)
   according to the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
   guidelines, focusing specifically on GHG emissions after the submersion
   of the reservoir. Results reveal that although hydropower is not as
   clean as we thought, it is still an absolute low emissions power type in
   China. The amount of GHG emissions produced by this station is 3.72
   million tons with an emissions coefficient of 32.63 g CO(2)eq/kWh. This
   figure is lower than that of thermal power, thus implying that
   hydropower is still a clean energy resource in China. Our
   recommendations to further minimize the environmental impacts of this

   utilization of new and improved construction materials, and the

Abstract = {{The present paper aims to elucidate impacts of climate change on the
   availability and security of water and energy in the Middle East and
   North Africa region (MENA region; including the Eastern Mediterranean)
   in the context of the water-energy nexus. It largely builds on existing
   knowledge and understanding and aims to present a review of existing
   information on this topic. The region is particularly challenged by a
   number of factors, including the large variability of bio-geographical
   characteristics, extreme population growth over the last few decades,
   and substantial societal and economical transitions, as well as armed
   conflicts in some of the countries in the region. Anticipated changes in
   climate conditions will exacerbate the challenges regarding water and
   energy security in the region. Major impacts of climate change include a
   significant increase in summer temperatures, which will lead to a
   growing number of heat waves, primarily in urban structures. A general
   decrease in precipitation in many of the MENA countries is foreseen,
   resulting in enhanced droughts and a growing number of dry spells. In
   addressing energy and water scarcities and their mutual
   interrelationships, an integrated water-energy nexus concept offers
   promising prospects to improve environmental, climate, human, and
   political security. However, only very few countries in the MENA region
   have presently implemented such a concept. Mitigation and adaptation
   strategies addressing water and energy scarcity include enhanced
   efficiency of resource use, integrated technology assessments regarding
   electricity generation, and a stronger reliance on renewable/solar
   technologies. While looking at the MENA region as a whole, some emphasis
   will be given to Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean.}},

Abstract = {{Gravel mulching has long been used to conserve water and enhance crop
   yield in the Loess Plateau of China. The climate change and water
   scarcity in the Loess Plateau of China may have an impact on the
   phenological changes of plants, thus affecting the growth process,
   biomass yield, energy input-output and economics of crops. However,
   focuses on the effects of gravel mulching on energy input-output and
   agricultural economics are less. Therefore, a 3-year field study of
   winter wheat was conducted with different gravel mulching practices in
   the Loess Plateau, China. The five treatments are: zero mulch (CK), 25\%
   surface gravel mulch (M1), 50\% surface gravel mulch (M2), 75\% surface
   gravel mulch (M3) and 100\% surface gravel mulch (M4), respectively. In
   addition, a set of indicator systems based on energy, economics and crop
   growth were proposed to better understand the effects of gravel
   mulching. Compared with the CK treatment, the gravel mulching treatments
   significantly prolonged the thermal time required for the plant growth
   and biomass accumulation and increased the growth rate of the Leaf area
   index (LAI), and ultimately improved the winter wheat yield. This effect
   was particularly evident during the jointing period of winter wheat. The
   results also showed that gravel mulching significantly increased energy
   use efficiency and net returns in economics. The four gravel mulching
   treatments significantly increased the biomass yield (4.9\%-17.3\%
   higher than the CK), net returns (12.1\%-53.8\% higher than the CK) and
   net returns water-use efficiency (WUEnre) (12.0\%-53.4\% higher than the
   CK). Accordingly, the energy productivity, net energy and net energy
   water-use efficiency (WUEene) were 2.2\%-8.2\%, 5.7\%-19.8\% and
   7.1\%-20.9\%, respectively, higher than the CK under M1-M4. Overall,
   gravel mulching exerted positive influences on the economic returns and
   the energy use, vs their water use efficiency. Thus, gravel mulching is
   not only an effective way to improve crop growth and yield, but it also
   has the potential to improve economic benefits and energy efficiency

Abstract = {{The energy sector is heavily dependent on surface water availability for
   reliable electricity generation. Power system operations are usually
   evaluated through system reliability and economic perspectives, with
   assumptions based on market prices and normal water availability. As
   natural gas technologies continue to dominate new thermal capacity,
   replacing retiring coal and nuclear generators, natural gas price
   stability becomes increasingly important and the impact of price
   volatility on grid operations must be understood. Here, we explore the
   range of Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) regional power
   operations, which represents the electric interconnection over the
   western half of the continental United States, using a production cost
   model driven by different fuel prices and an integrated hydrology model
   to simulate historical water availability. Our results show system-wide
   operation costs increasing in drought years or when gas prices increase,
   as expected. In addition, we found those system-wide increases can be of
   the same magnitude. Regional analysis of the responses to compounded
   droughts and price volatility highlight differences in magnitude and
   direction depending on regional generation technology portfolios. The
   Pacific Northwest is most sensitive to drought conditions, Southern
   California is most sensitive to gas prices, and the Desert Southwest is
   sensitive to both with the same magnitude. This analysis motivates
   further research in combined hydrology and power system modeling to
   characterize regional dynamics and associated uncertainties across
   scales, which is an important underpinning for the development of more
   resilient energy and water systems.}},

   The data collected by Sensor Fish can be used to predict fish

   newer Unit 4 had a higher median nadir pressure of 126 kPaA compared to
   99 kPaA. With respect to both pressure and acceleration, the older Unit
   1 had more severe hydraulic conditions. By understanding the physical
   conditions within existing hydropower projects, and the potential
   ecological impact those conditions could have on the local fauna, better
   informed decisions can be made regarding project operations. The results
   from this study can also be used to guide the engineering design of new
   hydropower turbines that will improve ecological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Climate-related factors (e.g. environmental energy, water availability
   and climatic seasonality/variability) and habitat heterogeneity have
   long been considered as the main drivers of species diversity on a broad
   spatial scale. However, it is controversial whether the above
   environmental factors can explain observed diversity patterns in varied
   communities such as invertebrate taxonomic group, especially mollusks.
   Moreover, there are until now few systematic assessments of the relative
   roles of different factors in determining the patterns of mollusk
   species diversity in monsoon-dominated regions. Here, we depict
   variations in terrestrial mollusk diversity based on a dataset
   comprising 282 assemblages collected from surface soils along an similar
   to 800-km climatic gradient from subtropical to warm temperate and
   mid-temperate regions in northern China. The results show that mollusk
   species diversity increases significantly from similar to 3-4 species to
   similar to 17-19 species when annual temperature and precipitation
   increase up to similar to 12 degrees C and similar to 700 mm,
   respectively; however, at or above these values the rate of increase is
   reduced. These indicate that the relationships between mollusk species
   diversity and climatic factors are nonlinear. Statistical analysis
   suggests that water availability (relative humidity) and temperature
   seasonality (January temperature and annual temperature range) dominate
   the observed pattern of mollusk species diversity. Moreover, habitat
   factors such as vegetation condition and soil types were also important
   in determining mollusk species diversity. They may be an indirect
   reflection of the effects of monsoonal water-energy dynamic on mollusk
   communities. Our results suggest that more attention should be paid to
   water availability and temperature seasonality in predicting future
   biodiversity changes, especially in the environmentally stressed
   northwestern part of the East Asian monsoon region. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Hydropower is a crucial no-fossil energy source, but it may cause

   Facing great hydroelectric capacity and water scarcity issue in China,
   water loss from hydropower deserves further valuation. This study used
   water footprint (WF) concept, employed the gross and net approach,
   collected domestic data, and evaluated China's national and regional WFs
   for hydroelectricity. Dam inventories were conducted covering 300
   hydropower plants. WFs were calculated considering local evaporation,
   evapotranspiration, allocation for multi-purpose reservoirs, and were
   evaluated by China's province for the first time. The results
   illustrated a significant regional variation. The average gross and net
   WF were at 3.021 (range of 0.08-122.31) Li kWh and 0.0763 (range of
   0-9.638) 1../kWh, respectively. WFs also showed a considerable seasonal
   variation with apparent regional characters. Impact of hydroelectric net
   WFs on local surface water was analyzed. Although hydropower WF was
   relatively low in China, several provinces with water scarcity issue
   were inappropriate for hydropower development. This research provided a
   comprehensive method for hydropower WF calculation and was supposed to

Abstract = {{Although hydropower and thermal power constitute the two pillars of

   whereas in the short run, they are competitive to a certain extent, even
   if factors such as precipitation, grid infrastructure and economic
   conditions are taken into account. The Granger causality test further
   reveals the one-way relationship between hydropower and thermal power in
   short run. That is, thermal power is dominant while hydropower is
   subordinate and passive, giving an empirical interpretation for the

Abstract = {{In recent times, more attention is given to renewable and clean energy
   sources that could ameliorate the current shortage of electricity
   plaguing South Africa. Due to the comparable use of hydrogen to fossil
   fuel in the transportation, industrial and electricity sector, hydrogen
   could be a potential solution to the current energy crises especially
   when produced from a clean and sustainable source. One of the most
   appropriate methods of green hydrogen production is the use of wind
   energy via water electrolysis. This paper therefore investigates the
   capability and viability of hydrogen production from the wind energy
   resources of South Africa using the actual wind speed obtained at 60 m
   anemometer height. Sensitivity analyses are also conducted to gain
   insight into the possible influences of wind turbine operating
   parameters on the cost of hydrogen production. Wind regime of fifteen
   (15) different sites across five (5) major provinces are analysed for
   possible wind-hydrogen production using eleven (11) different
   off-the-shelf wind turbines ranging from small to large categories. Some
   of the key results revealed that the mean wind speed (V-m) varies from
   5.07 m/s in Eston (S12) to 8.10 m/s in Napier (S5). Wind turbine WT9
   (ServionSE MM100) with rated wind power of 2 MW, cut-in wind speed of 2
   m/s, rated wind speed of 11 m/s, cut-out wind speed of 22 m/s and
   turbine hub-height of 100 m has the highest capacity factor (Cf) across
   all the sites with the values that range from 24.04\% in Eston (S12) to
   54.55\% in Napier. Site S5 presents the best hydrogen production
   potential with annual hydrogen production that ranges between 6.51
   metric-tons with turbine WT1 and 226.82 metric-tons of hydrogen with
   turbine WT11. Wind turbine WT9 has the least cost of electricity
   generation ranging from 0.23\$/kwh at site S5 to 0.42 \$/kwh at site
   S13. Also, the cost of hydrogen is lowest at site S5 and ranges between
   39.55 \$/kg using wind turbine WT1 and 1.4 \$/kg using wind turbine
   WT11. The sensitivity analysis conducted revealed that rated wind speed
   has significant effect on the cost of hydrogen production compared to
   other wind turbine parameters. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications

Abstract = {{To achieve sustainable development of hydroelectric resources, it is
   necessary to understand their availability, variability, and the
   expected impacts of climate change. Current research has mainly focused
   on estimating hydropower potential or determining the optimal locations

   historical trends of the resources. Herein, the hydropower potential
   variability from reconstructed streamflow series estimated with a
   non-parametric gap-filling method and geographic information systems
   (GIS) techniques are analyzed. The relationships between hydropower and
   large-scale climate variability, expressed by sea surface temperature,

   study. The results show significant interannual and inter-basin
   hydropower potential variability, with decreasing trends over time
   modulated by alternating positive and negative decadal trends; these
   modulations exhibit greater intensities than the general trends and are
   attributable to climatic oscillations such as El Nino. Future scenarios

Abstract = {{Multi-parallel grid-connected voltage source inverters (VSIs) are widely
   applied in the fields of renewable energy, energy storage, harmonic
   suppression, etc. However, these inverters may cause harmonic stability
   problems due to the interactions among the grid-connected inverters
   through the grid impedance, which can seriously threaten system
   stability. The impedance-based stability criterion provides an effective
   tool for analyzing harmonic instability issues and can be divided into
   two types, namely, a ratio type and a sum type. Based on the existing
   studies of the sum-type criterion, this paper further proposes a new
   sum-type form based on the global admittance from the PCC to assess
   system stability through frequency-domain analysis. This global
   admittance-based stability criterion can be used not only to analyze
   system stability, but also to reveal the influence of each VSI unit on
   system stability with a lower computational burden and provide guidance
   for resonance suppression, especially in the case of a large number of
   grid-connected inverters and asymmetric inverter parameters. Finally, a

Abstract = {{Water resources is a crucial environmental good for the function of the
   human societies and the ecosystems. Moreover, water is an important
   input for the economy and an indispensable factor for economic growth.
   Especially in regions that are facing water scarcity, the adoption of
   water management policies and approaches fostering the sustainable use
   of resources while promoting economic growth becomes an emerging issue.
   The Mediterranean region is one of the most vulnerable regions regarding
   the availability of water resources due to climate change and human
   activities. The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus offers an integrated
   approach analyzing the synergies and trade-offs between the different
   sectors in order to maximize the efficiency of using the resources,
   whereas adapting optimum policies and institutional arrangements. The
   Mediterranean is a region where we observe a large spectrum of issues
   emanating from water pollution and natural resource degradation to water
   scarcity, large amounts of food loss and waste and increasing demand for
   energy and food. Agricultural practices, urban development, demand
   management for water, and protection of ecosystems, particularly aquatic
   ecosystems, are areas of particular intervention available to the
   decision-makers in enhancing availability of water for the various water
   using sectors. In this context, the current policy note paper aims to
   address a major issue: how can the implementation of the WEF Nexus
   support the economic growth in the Mediterranean? Based on the outcome
   of an experts and stakeholders regional workshop, this paper presents
   the current status, including the opportunities and the practices of
   applying the WEF Nexus in the Mediterranean and draws specific
   recommendations for the way forward. Regarding the later, the
   strengthening of WEF Nexus in the Mediterranean requires a set of
   interventions to strengthen the institutional capacities, to enhance the
   finance mechanisms, to support the intra-regional dialogue as well, to
   enhance data collection and management, as well as to implement economic
   instruments and integrated economic approaches to measure the impact of

   technological development. The northern area faces great challenges with
   regard to energy intensity improvements, whereas the central regions
   suffer from large pressure relating to inefficient water use. The
   manufacture of non-metallic mineral products, smelting, and the pressing
   of metals are the largest suppliers of virtual water and embodied
   energy. The efficiency assessment results demonstrate that Jiangsu and
   Zhejiang are two DEA-effective regions. China has achieved a relatively
   high level of scale efficiency but suffers from backward technology.}},

Abstract = {{An unstable rock slope called the Guobu landslide, observed in granite
   with a maximum cumulative displacement of 45m, located on the upper
   stream of the dam of the Laxiwa Hydropower Station, China, and directly
   threatening the safety of the dam and the people living downstream, was
   investigated. Detailed field surveys, geological structure
   investigations, remote sensing image analysis, and GPS displacement
   monitoring were carried out to investigate the deformation
   characteristics of the slope after reservoir impoundment, historical
   deformation, ancient landslide reactivation, the influence factors of
   the large deformation of the slope, and the mechanism. Based on the
   results of the above analyses, it was seen that there is a clear
   geological structural dependence of the failure mechanisms in the study
   area, and that the complex failure mechanisms include toppling,
   subsiding wedge failure, rockfalls, and tension cracking in deep-seated
   rock masses. Moreover, analysis of the remote sensing images indicated
   that the ancient landslide had been reactivated between 2005 and 2008.
   Detailed field displacement monitoring data showed that the whole slope
   was deforming significantly and continuously with the increase of the
   water level in the reservoir. The displacement rate had a positive
   correlation with the variation of the reservoir water level, increasing
   and decreasing as the the latter rose and fell, respectively. The
   vulnerable geological conditions, water infiltration, and the reservoir
   impoundment were the main factors causing the large deformation of the
   Guobu landslide. Water infiltration was the driving force resulting in
   the reactivation of the ancient landslide, and the reservoir impoundment
   accelerated the slope deformation. The mechanism of the large
   deformation of the rock slope was a combination of the upper pushing
   deformation induced by wedging and toppling, due to the ancient
   landslide reactivation, and the lower traction deformation due to the
   reservoir impoundment.}},

Abstract = {{Agro-ecosystem is an open system that represents a complex interaction
   with the environment in term of energy transformation. Growing human
   population and resultant demand for greater output are increasing the
   rate of energy flow in agro-ecosystem to facilitate more energy
   transformation, which is deteriorating different compartment of
   ecosystem and environment. This paper intends to analyse agricultural
   sustainability at micro level by developing a composite indicator of
   land, water and energy used for crop production. Cropland footprint
   (CF), water footprint (WF) and entropy overproduction (E-op) are
   selected as indicators of land, water and energy respectively with the
   objective to explore man-land interaction by CF, while WF and E-op
   represent the impact of that interaction. In the study area, cropland
   surplus or deficit is inversely related with WF and E-op. Surplus crops
   like paddy and potato have higher WF and E-op, hence are responsible for
   agricultural unsustainability. WF and E-op are highest for paddy (8912
   m(3)/ha) and potato (117,565 MJ/ha) respectively. Grey water footprint
   (WFc,grey) is the highest for potato (3708 m(3)/ha). Pulses (with
   negative E-op of -9124 MJ/ha) are proved the most sustainable crop with
   the highest potentiality to boost agro-ecosystem sustainability. The
   results derived from the analysis indicate that increasing use of
   chemicals and more specialization of water and energy exhaustive crops
   are reducing agricultural sustainability. The study also suggests for
   necessary transformations of cropping pattern with special emphasis on
   incorporation of pulses, oilseeds etc. and non-productive energy
   investment to reinstall natural quality of agro-ecosystem, not only in
   the studied areas, but also in other areas facing similar site and

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental and numerical study on the energy
   performance of a water / soil heat exchanger coupled to a cooling floor.
   The system shows two galvanized steel water tanks embedded at a shallow
   depth of 2 m from the ground and each with a volume of 2 m(3). The
   experimental set up has enabled us to study these two cases: The first
   case considers the two tanks connected in parallel and coupled to the
   room, whereas the second case considers only one tank coupled to the
   cooling floor. An experimental device has been setup to measure the
   temperatures at different points as follow: indoor air temperature;
   surface temperature of the cooling floor; inlet and outlet tank
   temperatures. Experimental results were compared with those obtained
   from the simulation using Trnsys tools and a fair similarity was
   obtained. The numerical model made it possible to run a parametric study
   which revealed the most influential parameters on the energy efficiency
   of this system. A control strategy has been proposed to improve the
   energy efficiency of the water / soil heat exchanger. The control
   strategy used allows a lowering of the cooling floor surface temperature
   at the order of 2.5 degrees C, the indoor air temperature at the order
   of 6 degrees C and the water outlet temperature of the tank at 2 degrees
   C. The supply of night ventilation was introduced into the system with a
   regulation relative to the outside temperature. The control strategy of
   the underground tank systems and night ventilation gives an indoor air
   temperature reduction of 9 degrees C compared to the case without heat
   source, which gives a coverage rate of 65\%. Results obtained on the
   feasibility of this technique in the Mediterranean climate are
   promising.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{The Mpumalanga Province is a key source of South Africa's coal supply
   with over 60\% of the province's surface area either being subject to
   mining rights or prospecting applications. Mpumalanga also possesses
   almost half of the country's high potential arable land. While South
   Africa is currently largely self-sufficient in terms of cereal grains,
   what this assessment of Mpumalanga highlights is that food security is
   increasingly being threatened by coal mining interests that serve the
   nation's energy needs. Water availability and quality for mining,
   agriculture and energy production in this province are also becoming
   increasingly strained. The water quality deterioration generally results
   from either acid mine drainage (AMD) or contaminated runoff from mines
   and agricultural lands. This assessment of Mpumalanga highlights the
   interconnectedness of energy, food, and water security, with their
   resultant trade-offs. The water-energy-food (WEF) nexus provides a
   focussed lens through which to evaluate resource security in a holistic
   manner. Only once regulators, NGOs, industry, and the public view the
   resource security challenges in Mpumalanga in an integrated manner can
   planning and policies that lead to sustainable development be advanced,
   and objectives such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) be
   achieved. There is, therefore, a need for WEF nexus science and data to
   influence integrated public policy within this province.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{271}},
Pages = {{295-306}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural ecosystems are important for regulating terrestrial
   hydrological and carbon cycles. Hydrological and carbon processes in
   agricultural ecosystem models are complex due to interactions between
   parameters. It is therefore crucial to identify parameter sensitivity
   before a process-based model is applied for simulations and predictions
   of water, energy and carbon fluxes in agricultural ecosystems. In this
   study, we investigated the sensitivity and equifinality of the CoupModel
   parameters in modeling an arid agricultural ecosystem in northwestern
   China. In total, 27 model parameters were analyzed using a global
   parameters sensitivity analysis approach and a combination of multiple
   in situ and remotely sensed data sets. Among the five major model
   processes, we found that the energy balance process account for much of
   the importance in the model, followed by soil hydrology, plant growth,
   soil heat, and soil carbon processes. Meanwhile, parameters from the
   plant growth process exhibited higher equifinalities than other
   processes. We found that net ecosystem exchange (NEE) is controlled by
   soil heat, soil hydrology and energy balance processes, which is mainly
   due to a high equifinality (0.91) between the parameters g(max) (maximal
   stomatal conductance) and V-cmax (maximal carboxylation rate). The
   equifinalities between different parameters result in a trade-off in
   model performance metrics (i.e. determination coefficient R-2 and mean
   error ME) in the water, energy and carbon balance simulations. We
   revealed that daytime and yearly accumulated eddy fluxes (sensible heat
   H-s, latent heat LE and NEE) can constrain the model parameters better.
   Remotely sensed data were also promising as additional constraints on
   soil water contents and energy fluxes. This study introduced a
   systematic global parameter sensitivity analysis approach together with
   the equifinality identification in an ecosystem model. The approach
   proposed here is applicable to other studies and the equifinalities
   detected in this study can be important implications for modelling arid
   agricultural ecosystems. Additional exploration on remotely sensed data
   in constraining the model from different aspects are highly recommended
   in modeling agricultural ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Coal-fired power generation will dominate the electricity supply in
   China in the foreseeable future. Coal fired power units can play a
   crucial role in integrating intermittent wind energy and improving the
   overall energy efficiency of the power system. The integration benefits
   of wind power, along with the gains of high load rates of coal fired
   units, should be fully taken into account. An optimal model combining
   wind power and coal fired units is built to analyze the operational
   flexibility of coal fired units and the integration of wind power.
   Taking the coal fired units in North China Power Grid as an example, the
   dispatch costs and benefits are examined under the energy efficiency
   dispatch mode, in comparison with those under the fair dispatch rules
   and the installed capacity. The results show that increasing the
   flexibility of the power system under the energy efficiency dispatch
   mode may be the best choice for the power system with the high share of
   coal fired units to integrate more wind power, and that the units
   delivering flexibility services are financially influenced. The results
   also indicate that a certain amount of wind power curtailment may be
   reasonable, and that rational penalty rate and fees for the curtailment
   of wind power may help to optimize the operation of the power system and
   integrate more wind power. Based on these results, policy and strategy
   recommendations are proposed to promote the flexibility of coal fired
   units and change their operation mode and their dispatch mode in the

   hydropower station reregulation: A case study from Gezhouba Hydropower
   Plant, China}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{573}},
Pages = {{895-907}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The forecasting accuracy of downstream water levels greatly impacts the
   economic operation of reregulating hydropower stations. If present,
   large errors in water level forecasting may require the hydropower
   station to discard water, which decreases the revenue from hydropower
   generation. Especially when the reregulating hydropower station
   undertakes the task of peak load regulation of the power grid, its power
   output may change drastically over a short period of time. Such large
   changes in the discharged flow of the hydropower station may inevitably
   cause an unsteady flow, which can lead to large fluctuations in the
   water levels of downstream rivers. In this case, the current forecasting
   methods, such as standard rating curves and empirical formulae, may
   inevitably result in large deviations when forecasting the change in the
   downstream water level. In order to reduce the volume of water discarded
   as a result of forecasting errors, a back propagation neural
   network-based forecasting model for downstream water levels of a
   reregulating hydropower station was constructed. The model enabled the
   direct, accurate, real-time forecasting of changes in downstream water
   levels by using measurable operation data from a hydropower station and
   process data on downstream water level changes. This method was applied
   to the actual hydropower generation dispatch of the Gezhouba Hydropower
   Plant in China. The results showed that as the peak load regulation
   volume increased, the forecasting errors of two conventional methods
   (standard rating curves and empirical formulae) became continuously
   superimposed. However, the water level forecasting error of the neural
   network-based method was small and could fully meet the real-time
   dispatching requirements of the hydropower station. In particular, under
   large peak load regulations, the maximum absolute values of the
   forecasting errors of the two conventional methods were close to 1 m,
   while that of the neural network-based method could be controlled within
   0.3 m.}},

Abstract = {{Energy is consumed at every stage of the cycle of water production,

   the developmental needs of developing-country partners. Over the past
   six decades, India has emerged as a major donor and development partner,
   directing a significant share of its assistance and investments to
   countries in South Asia. This paper provides an overview of India's
   development cooperation with Bhutan, the largest and one of the oldest
   beneficiaries of Indian assistance, with special attention to the
   hydropower sector. In recent years, the scale of India's disbursement
   and development cooperation activities in Bhutan has come under
   scrutiny. In this paper, we document the official views, and those of
   the international organisations and the media in India and Bhutan, on
   the possible repercussions of these activities in the near, medium and
   long term and how the different concerns are being addressed. We argue
   that in future India will have to work harder to alleviate the key
   concerns of stakeholders in Bhutan regarding India's growing investments
   there.}},

Abstract = {{Of all the challenges facing the sustainability of cities, water, food
   and energy are the most critical. In the context of rapid urbanization,
   unsustainable human activities have resulted in fundamental changes in
   the structure and function of land cover and urban water systems, and
   the degradation of ecosystem services. Taking Beijing - a typical
   fast-growing mega city - as an example, to establish a food-energy-water
   impact model, this research studied the temporal-spatial changes in the
   water system pattern in a mega city, along with the driving forces,
   especially the nexus to rice production and energy, and the ensuing
   series of environmental impacts.
   On the basis of land use data, remote sensing images, and thematic maps
   from 1993, 2001 and 2007, water system information was extracted and
   adjusted for Beijing. With the aid of RS and GIS techniques, the water
   system was classified into four types, and the spatial and temporal
   dynamic of the landscape patterns of Beijing's water system
   systematically was analyzed. The landscape metrics were then calculated
   using FRAGSTATS 3.3. The results show that the total area of water
   system in Beijing declined from 63,494 ha to 43,652 ha from 1993 to
   2007. The decrease of the linear water surface is more significant than
   that of the non-linear water surface. In the terms of landscape metrics
   change, the number of patches has decreased from 5510 to 5396. The
   density indexes have increased by 40.61\%, the average area of patches
   has decreased by 30.18\%, the patch shape has tended to become more
   regular, and the overall pattern of the water system is becoming more
   fragmented. Urban sprawl, the shortage of water resources, and the
   increasing amount of construction land are the major reasons accounting
   for the changes in the water system in Beijing. Because of these
   changes, farmland has decreased by 212,428 ha, and especially rice paddy
   fields, are significantly decreasing from 52,200 ha in 1980 to 199.6 ha
   in 2015, a decrease of 99.62\%. Consequently, rice production is
   decreasing by 99.61\%, more energy is being consumed for food
   production. Meanwhile, the local water supply rate has decreased from
   100\% to 78.4\% between 2001 to 2016, the underground water level has
   decreased by 14.24 m from 1994 to 2016. There is more competition for
   water resources, more urban water flooding disasters, and emerging urban
   environmental problems such as declining underground water level, posing
   a serious threat to the sustainability of the city. Therefore, a
   systematic and smart thinking is needed to analyze the complex land use
   - water - food - energy relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, the demand for energy has increased significantly in last two
   decades, leading to an increased use of non-renewable energy resources.
   The global agenda aims to reduce the carbon intensity of energy in
   long-term climate change mitigation strategies, and to achieve
   Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG-7) on affordable and clean energy.
   Use of renewable energy (RE) can contribute to reducing global
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while providing incremental financial
   resources to stimulate clean development mechanisms. Hydropower
   continues to be the leading RE option and has the additional benefits of
   water storage for agriculture and other uses. Drawing on the position of
   four Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) countries - Bangladesh, India, Nepal and
   Pakistan - this paper investigates the current status of hydropower
   generation and related policies, and attempts to identify the key
   challenges to and opportunities for hydropower development in the
   region. Collectively, four HKH countries have commercially feasible
   hydropower potential of nearly 190 GW. However, only one-third of this
   potential has actually been tapped so far. Nepal and Pakistan have
   tapped 2\% and 12\%, respectively, of their hydropower potential. The
   current hydropower supply has not been able to fulfill the electricity
   demand in the region, where 26-37\% of the rural population is living
   without access to electricity, and future demand for electricity is
   likely to increase sharply. There are several economic, social,
   technical, environmental, ecological and political challenges to
   hydropower production in the HKH countries. Despite these challenges,
   hydropower remains an important option for achieving renewable energy
   goals in the region. To achieve these goals, we suggest capitalizing on
   emerging opportunities such as large hydropower development using a
   `smart approach', micro-hydropower promotion, energy trade, and regional
   cooperation for collective energy development programs.}},

Abstract = {{To satisfy the huge energy demand of China, a rapid development rate of
   hydropower system was undertaken over the past decades. Currently,
   thousands of hydropower reservoirs with a total installed capacity of

Abstract = {{The high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) is reshaping the electricity
   net-load curve and has a significant impact on power system operation
   and planning. The concept of duck curve is widely used to describe the
   timing imbalance between peak demand and PV generation. The traditional
   duck curve is deterministic and only shows a single extreme or typical
   scenario during a day. Thus, it cannot capture both the probability of
   that scenario and the uncertainty of PV generation and loads. These
   weaknesses limit the application of the duck curve on power system
   planning under high PV penetration. To address this issue, the novel
   concepts of probabilistic duck curve (PDC) and probabilistic ramp curve
   (PRC) are proposed to accurately model the uncertainty and variability
   of electricity net load and ramp under high PV penetration. An efficient
   method is presented for modeling PDC and PRC using kernel density
   estimation, copula function, and dependent discrete convolution. Several
   indices are designed to quantify the characteristics of the PDC and PRC.
   For the application, we demonstrate how the PDC and PRC will benefit
   flexible resource planning. Finally, an empirical study on the Qinghai
   provincial power system of China validates the effectiveness of the
   presented method. The results of PDC and PRC intuitively illustrate that
   the ramp demand and the valley of net load face considerable uncertainty
   under high PV penetration. The results of flexible resource planning
   indicate that retrofitting coal-fired units has remarkable performance
   on enhancing the power system flexibility in Qinghai. In average,
   reducing the minimal output of coal-fired units by 1 MW will increase PV
   accommodation by over 4 MWh each day.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the booming electricity demand and intermittent energy has
   sharply increased the peak shaving pressure in China. However, for a
   majority of regional power grids in China, the installed capacity of
   flexible energy (like hydropower and pumped-storage) is small and the
   thermal plants are asked to respond the sudden load change at peak
   periods. The existing method based on specialist experience and
   historical information may generate inferior solutions and fail to
   reduce the peak pressure. Thus, a practical mixed integer linear
   programming (MILP) model is developed for unit commitment of thermal
   plants with peak shaving operation aspect in regional power grid lack of
   flexible hydropower energy, where the goal is chosen to minimize the
   peak-valley difference of the residual load series obtained by
   subtracting all the thermal generation from the original load curve
   while satisfying the necessary physical constraints. The MILP model is
   used to the thermal system in the China's largest regional power grid,
   East China Power Grid. The simulations show that the MILP model can
   effectively smooth the residual load curve by gathering power generation
   of thermal plants at peak periods. Therefore, an alternative tool is
   provided to alleviate the peak pressure of thermal-dominant regional

Abstract = {{The run-off volume altered by the construction of hydropower plants
   affects ecohydrological processes in catchments. Although the impacts of
   large hydropower plants have been well documented in the literature, few
   studies have been conducted on the impacts of small cascaded hydropower
   plants (SCHPs). To evaluate the impacts of SCHPs on river flow, we chose
   a representative basin affected by hydropower projects and, to a lesser
   degree, by other human activities, that is, the Qiuxiang River basin in
   Southern China. The observed river discharge and climate data during the
   period of 1958-2016 were investigated. The datasets were divided into a
   low-impact period and a high-impact period based on the number of SCHPs
   and the capacities of the reservoirs. The daily river discharge
   alteration was assessed by applying the Indicators of Hydrologic
   Alteration. To separate the impact of the SCHPs on the local river
   discharge from that of climate-related precipitation, the
   back-propagation neural network was used to simulate the monthly average
   river discharge process. An abnormal result was found: Unlike large
   reservoirs in large watersheds, the SCHPs regulated the flows during the
   flood season but were not able to mitigate the droughts during the dry
   season due to their limited storage and the commonly occurring
   inappropriate interregulations of the SCHPs. The SCHPs also reduced the
   annual average river discharge in the research basin. The contribution
   of the SCHPs to the river discharge changes was 85.37\%, much higher
   than the contributions of climate change (13.43\%) and other human
   activities (1.20\%). The results demonstrated that the impacts of the
   SCHPs were different from those of large dams and reservoirs that
   regulate floods and relieve droughts. It is necessary to raise the
   awareness of the impacts of these river barriers.}},

   five major existing methods of electricity generation in China were
   considered: thermal power, nuclear power, hydro power, wind power, and

   food production, and energy production. At a district-level scale in
   China, we integrated key Chinese data sets from multiple industrial,
   commercial, and agricultural sectors together with key land use and
   hydrologic information to evaluate the FEW parameters normalized to the
   land area of each district rather than the commonly used approach where
   FEW consumptive parameters are normalized to population (i.e., per
   capita). The results illustrated the types of data sets currently
   available within China to conduct FEW system analyses and identified
   districts that are net producers or dependents regarding food, energy,
   or water. The northeastern portion of the Yangtze River basin have
   several districts that are net negative relative to the amount of water
   that falls within the district boundaries versus all water uses plus
   evaporation, with the most stressed districts lacking as much as 0.5-1 m
   annually of equivalent rainfall per unit land area. The geospatial
   analysis concludes that policies to manage the FEW system cannot be
   considered for a single district alone, nor the Yangtze River watershed
   in its entirety, but instead needs to consider the interdependencies
   among districts and consider encouraging growth (agriculture, industry,
   or population) within more water-abundant regions.}},

Abstract = {{With the constant increase of population and urbanization worldwide,
   stress on water, energy, and food resources is growing. Climate change
   constitutes a source of vulnerability, raising the importance of
   implementing actions to mitigate it. Within this, the water and
   wastewater sector represents an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions, during both the construction and operation phase. The scope
   of this study is to analyze the GHG emissions from the current and
   future water supply scheme, as well as to draw a comparison between
   possible water reclamation with resource recovery scenarios in the town
   Leh in India: a centralized scheme, a partly centralized combined with a
   decentralized scheme, and a household level approach. Precise values of
   emission factors, based on the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse
   Gas Inventories, previous studies, and Ecoinvent database, have been
   adopted to quantify the different emissions. Potential sources of
   reduction of GHG emissions through sludge and biogas utilization have
   been identified and quantified to seize their ability to mitigate the
   carbon footprint of the water and wastewater sector. The results show
   that the future water supply scheme will lead to a significant increase
   of the GHG emissions during its operation. Further, it is shown that
   decentralizing wastewater management in Leh town has the least carbon
   footprint during both construction and operation phases. These results
   have implications for cities worldwide.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this paper was to compare primary energy consumption
   and energy efficiency during the operation phase of different types and
   combinations of water heating systems in single-family dwellings.
   Systems with an electric shower, liquefied petroleum gas heater, and
   solar heater with electric backup were analysed. The analysis was
   performed by means of computer simulation using EnergyPlus. Three
   Brazilian cities with different climates were assessed, i.e., Curitiba,
   Brasilia and Belem. The systems were compared in terms of final energy
   and primary energy consumption. Results showed that systems with an
   electric shower, which have a lower water flow rate, led to lower
   primary energy consumption. The solar heating system combined with an
   electric shower was the option with the lowest energy consumption, and
   the solar heating system with a heating element in the storage tank was
   the option that consumed more energy. The systems were sized according
   to the requirements of the Brazilian energy efficiency labelling for
   residential buildings, and the efficiency level was compared to the
   results of primary energy consumption. The electric shower was found to
   be the third lowest energy consumer, but it was ranked the least energy
   efficient by Brazilian labelling, while systems with high energy
   consumption, such as gas heaters and solar heaters with a heating
   element in the storage tank, were ranked the most energy efficient.
   Therefore, a review of the requirements and methodology of the Brazilian
   energy efficiency labelling for residential buildings is recommended in
   order to encourage the use of truly efficient systems. Public policies
   that encourage solar heating systems should establish requirements
   regarding the configuration and sizing both the solar heating system and
   the backup system.}},

   Strategies: A Case Study in the Upper Han River, China}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Climate change and human activities are two driving factors that affect
   the hydrological cycle of watersheds and water resource evolution. As a
   pivotal input to hydropower stations, changes in runoff processes may
   reduce the effectiveness of existing operation procedures. Therefore, it
   is important to analyze the influences of cascade hydropower stations
   under climate change and human activities and to propose revised optimal
   operation strategies. For the present study, three runoff series
   conditions including: Initial runoff, affected by only climate change,
   and affected by both climate change and human activities are examined by
   a simulation model to analyze the influence on power generation with
   four schemes. Additionally, an optimal operation model of cascade power
   stations is proposed based on the simulation model to generate single
   and joint optimal operation charts for future hydrological scenarios.
   The paper also proposes to change human activities based on optimizing
   operation rules to reduce its influence on downstream power stations.
   This procedure is theoretically applied and varied for three power
   stations in the upper Han River, China. The results show that the
   influence of climate change is greater than that of human activities in
   that power generation decreased by 17.95\% and 12.83\%, respectively,
   whereas combined, there is a reduction of 25.71\%. Under existing
   hydrological conditions, the modified single and joint operation charts
   would increase power generation by about 32 million and 47 million kWh.
   Furthermore, after optimizing the upstream project, the abandoned water
   and power generation of these cascade power stations would reduce by 150
   million m(3) and 5 million kWh, respectively. This study has practical
   significance for the efficient operation of cascade hydropower stations
   and is helpful for developing reservoir operation theory under changing
   environments.}},

   First, an index system for assessing coupling and coordination degrees

   subsystems as well as the coupling and coordination degrees of the core
   WEF nexus in China were calculated. The results showed that from 2007 to
   2016, the mean value of the coupling degree was 0.746 (range (0.01, 1)),
   which was a high level. This proved that the three resources were
   interdependent. Hence, it was necessary to study their relationship.
   However, the mean value of the coordination degree was 0.395 (range (0,
   1)), which was a low level. This showed that the coordination
   development of the core WEF nexus in China was low. It is necessary to
   take some measures to improve the situation. According to the key

Abstract = {{The Appalachian Mountains serve as a water source for important
   population centers in the eastern and midwestern United States. Despite
   this, the effects of climate change on the hydroclimatology of the
   region have not been thoroughly assessed, and its effects for water
   resources remain uncertain. In this study, we analyze the effects of
   climate change in a holistic approach to consider differential changes
   between atmospheric water supply (precipitation) and atmospheric water
   demand (potential evapotranspiration). We analyze the absolute and
   relative changes in both variables, as well as their relation (aridity
   index) and future projected shifts in their seasonality. Our findings
   show that precipitation is projected to increase in the northeastern
   part of the region and decrease in the southwest with a transition zone
   in the central Appalachians. Potential evapotranspiration increases
   consistently throughout the twenty-first century at a higher rate than
   precipitation, increasing the aridity of the region except for some
   small localized pockets at high elevations. The seasonality of
   precipitation indicates different shifts across the region related to
   changes in the dominant synoptic drivers of the region and changes in
   the seasonal characteristics of the land surface. All changes are
   exacerbated in the most extreme future climate scenario, highlighting
   the importance of local to global policies toward a more sustainable
   water resources development. In addition, we perform a basin-scale
   assessment on 20 major rivers with headwaters within the ``Appalachian
   Region.{''} Our basin-scale results enforce the gridded regional results
   and indicate that, as temperatures continue to increase, lowland areas
   will rely more heavily on higher-elevation forested headwater catchments

Abstract = {{Optimizing water-food-energy (WFE) relations has been widely discussed
   in recent years as an effective approach for formulating pathways toward
   sustainable agricultural production and energy supply. However,
   knowledge regarding the WFE nexus is still largely lacking, particularly
   beyond the conceptual description. In this study, we combined a
   grid-based crop model (Python-based Environmental Policy Integrated
   Climate-PEPIC) with a hydropower scheme based on the Distributed
   Biosphere Hydrological (DBH) model to investigate the WFE interplays in
   China concerning irrigated agricultural production and hydropower
   potential. The PEPIC model was used to estimate crop yields and
   irrigation water requirements under various irrigated cropland
   scenarios, while the DBH model was applied to simulate hydrological
   processes and associated hydropower potential. Four major crops, i.e.,
   maize, rice, soybean, and wheat, were included for the analyses. Results
   show that irrigation water requirements present high values (average
   about 400mm yr(-1)) in many regions of northern China, where crop yields
   are much higher on irrigated land than on rainfed land. However,
   agricultural irrigation has largely reduced hydropower potential up to
   50\% in some regions due to the substantial withdrawal of water from
   streams. The Yellow River basin, the Hai River basin, and the Liao River
   basin were identified as the hotspot regions concerning the WFE
   interactions and tradeoffs. Further expansion the irrigated cropland
   would increase the tradeoffs between supporting sustainable food
   production and conserving hydropower potential in many parts of China.
   The results provide some insights into the WFE nexus and the information
   derived is useful for supporting sustainable water management, food

Abstract = {{In the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations worldwide pledged emissions
   reductions (Nationally Determined Contributions-NDCs) to avert the
   threat of climate change, and agreed to periodically review these
   pledges to strengthen their level of ambition. Previous studies have
   analyzed NDCs largely in terms of their implied contribution to limit
   global warming, their implications on the energy sector or on mitigation
   costs. Nevertheless, a gap in the literature exists regarding the
   understanding of implications of the NDCs on countries' Energy-Water
   Land nexus resource systems. The present paper explores this angle
   within the regional context of Latin America by employing the Global
   Change Assessment Model, a state-of-the-art integrated assessment model
   capable of representing key system-wide interactions among nexus sectors
   and mitigation policies. By focusing on Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and
   Colombia, we stress potential implications on national-level water
   demands depending on countries' strategies to enforce energy-related
   emissions reductions and their interplays with the land sector. Despite
   the differential implications of the Paris pledges on each country,
   increased water demands for crop and biomass irrigation and for
   electricity generation stand out as potential trade-offs that may emerge

Abstract = {{Dysprosium(III) ions are the third most luminescent lanthanide(III)
   ions. Dy(III) is used as dopant in optical fibers and as shift reagent
   in NMR imaging and is the element at the forefront of research in
   single-molecule magnets. Nonetheless, the excited state manifold of the
   dysprosium(III) ion is not fully mapped and the nature of the emitting
   state has not been unequivocally assigned. In the work reported here,
   the photophysical properties of dysprosium(III) triflate dissolved in
   H2O, MeOH, and DMSO have been studied in great detail. The solvates are
   symmetric, all oxygen donor atom complexes where the coordination number
   is 8 or 9. By comparing protonated and deuterated solvents, performing
   variable temperature spectroscopy, and determining the excited state
   lifetimes and luminescence quantum yields, the solution structure can be
   inferred. For the three complexes, the observed electronic energy levels
   were determined using absorption and emission spectroscopy. The Dy(III)
   excited state manifolds of the three solvates differ from that reported
   by Carnall, in particular for the low lying F-6-states. It is shown that
   dysprosium(III) complexes primarily luminesce from the F-4(9/2) state,
   although thermal population of, and subsequent luminescence from the
   I-4(15/2) state is observed. The intrinsic luminescence quantum yield is
   moderate (similar to 10\%) in DMSO-d(6) and is significantly reduced in
   protonated solvent as both C-H and O-H oscillators act as efficient
   quenchers of the F-4(9/2) state. We are able to conclude that the
   emitting state in dysprosium(III) is F-4(9/2), that the m(j) levels must
   be considered when determining electronic energy levels of
   dysprosium(III), and that scrutiny of the transition probabilities may
   reveal the structure of dysprosium(III) ions in solution.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Sustainable production of algae will depend on understanding trade-offs
   at the energy-water nexus. Algal biofuels promise to improve the
   environmental sustainability profile of renewable energy along most
   dimensions. In this assessment of potential US freshwater production, we
   assumed sustainable production along the carbon dimension by simulating
   placement of open ponds away from high-carbon-stock lands (forest,
   grassland, and wetland) and near sources of waste CO
   2. Along the water dimension, we quantified trade-offs between water
   scarcity and production for an upstream' indicator (measuring minimum
   water supply) and a downstream' indicator (measuring impacts on rivers).
   For the upstream indicator, we developed a visualization tool to
   evaluate algae production for different thresholds for water surplus. We
   hypothesized that maintaining a minimum seasonal water surplus would
   also protect river habitat for aquatic biota. Our study confirmed that
   ensuring surplus water also reduced the duration of low-flow events, but
   only above a threshold. We also observed a trade-off between algal
   production and the duration of low-flow events in streams. These results
   can help to guide the choice of basin-specific sustainability targets to
   avoid conflicts with competing water users at this energy-water nexus.
   Where conflicts emerge, alternative water sources or enclosed

Abstract = {{Although the relationships between water and energy systems have been
   widely researched globally, such studies have not properly considered
   the coupling and driving mechanisms of the nexus between water and
   energy. Based on panel data from 30 Chinese provinces and cities, we
   used a three-stage Slacks-Based Measure model for Data Envelopment
   Analysis (SBM-DEA) to estimate the Water-Energy coupling efficiency in
   China from 2003-2015. Using the Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA)
   regression model, we constructed an index of environmental factors that
   affect the Water-Energy coupling efficiency from the four aspects of
   resource environment, social environment, economic environment, and
   ecological environment. The results indicate that the Water-Energy
   coupling efficiency scores in most provinces in China are high and
   stable, and that the coupling efficiency of water and energy in China
   has a distribution pattern of northeast > east > west > central.
   Compared to the results in the first stage of analysis, the efficiency
   values in the third stage (after removal of environmental and stochastic
   factors) were smaller, illustrating that the coupling efficiency of
   water and energy in China depends on a favorable external environment.
   In the sample period, we also found that the improvement of the resource

Abstract = {{Recently, various toppling slopes have emerged with the development of
   hydropower projects in the western mountainous regions of China. The
   slope on the right bank of the Laxiwa Hydropower Station, located on the
   mainstream of the Yellow River in the Qinghai Province of Northwest
   China, is a typical hard rock slope. Further, its deformation

   stages of deformation have been identified using discrete element
   numerical software and geological engineering analysis methods,
   including toppling creep, initial toppling deformation, intensified
   toppling deformation, and current slope formation. The spatial and
   time-related deformation of this site also exhibited four stages,

Abstract = {{This work analyzes the impacts on the power system expansion planning of
   implementing CO2 and local pollutant emission taxes under five different
   policy-relevant scenarios. To do this, we have formulated and
   implemented an optimization model based on a mixed-integer linear
   program, which determines the optimal expansion plan considering the
   installation of both large-scale power plants and renewable-based
   distributed generation. An important characteristic of the proposed
   model is that it includes a detailed formulation of the power system.
   Moreover, differently than existing literature, special attention is
   given to the analysis of the spatial-temporal distributive effects of
   pollutant taxes, considering both global and local pollutant emissions.
   The method is applied to the main Chilean power system. Our results
   indicate that global and local pollutant taxes significantly impact both
   planning and operational decisions in the power system. In particular,
   pollutant taxes may have significant spatial distributive effects, as
   shown in the analysis of 13 regions of Chile, leading to damages in some
   specific regions while relatively benefiting others. Our results also
   show that the availability of renewable energy capacity may improve the
   effectiveness of pollutant taxes. Particularly, adding 1.5 GW of hydro
   capacity to the Chilean system allows avoiding around 32 GWh of fossil
   fuel generation per year, saving more than 1.5 billion US\$ in the
   10-year horizon considered. The proposed method and qualitative results
   are sufficiently generic to apply to any other jurisdiction.}},

   increasing significant role as transmission centers in the upstream

Abstract = {{The water and sediment yields of rivers are changing substantially under
   the impacts of climate variability and anthropogenic activities, which
   are increasingly becoming an important research topic in the field of
   hydro-environmental science. This study presents a comprehensive
   investigation of the changes in runoff depth (h), specific sediment
   yield (SSY), and flow-sediment relationship at multi-temporal scales in
   the Han River Basin (HRB). The effects of climate variability and
   anthropogenic activities on SSY were quantified by employing double
   cumulative curve analysis. The results are as follows: (1) The annual
   and flood season h and SSY in the midstream (Huangzhuang Station) during
   the past six decades presented declining trends. The detected change
   points (i.e., 1968 and 1984) in SSY were linked to the reservoir and dam
   construction and soil and water conservation programs. The Danjiangkou
   (DJK) Reservoir impounded water in the flood season and supplied water
   in the non-flood season, which made the intra-annual distributions of h
   and SSY more even and the intra-annual variations more moderate in the
   comparisons between the pre- and post-change periods. (2) The annual and
   flood-season flow-sediment relationships were fitted with the power
   function and the sediment productive ability of runoff in the flood
   season was much greater than that in the non-flood season. The
   construction and operation of the DJK Reservoir intercepted a
   significant quantity of sediment; thus, the sediment transported by unit
   runoff largely declined. (3) The estimated relative contributions of
   climate variability and anthropogenic activities to the changes in SSY
   suggested that the anthropogenic activities played a more substantial
   role in the SSY decline after the transition years. Sustainable
   development of the HRB will face many challenges as the water and
   sediment discharges decrease further from the Han River into the Yangtze
   River. These results will provide a reference for better soil and water
   resource conservation and draw more attention to strengthen the river
   basin management.}},

Abstract = {{China is rapidly expanding its alternative and non-conventional energy
   production capabilities. Although renewable electricity remains the
   focus, considerable investment has supported construction of coal
   liquefaction and coal gasification facilities in the desert steppes of
   north-central China, new coal mines in arid Inner Mongolia, and tight
   oil and gas extraction in the Ordos to supplement limited domestic
   supplies of oil and gas. At the same time, China is also facing severe
   drought and water scarcity in these same regions and in response has
   expanded various water supply technologies such as desalination and
   wastewater treatment. Recent government goals and measures for reducing
   energy and water consumption and increasing efficiency introduced in
   national policies, however, are poorly or not coordinated, resulting in
   contradictory objectives for which physical interlinkages are not well
   understood. This research intends to provide insights for future
   energy-water nexus management decisions in China, through systematic,
   comprehensive modeling of the water-energy nexus in China based on
   comprehensive, bottom-up technology characterizations. Existing studies
   fail to adequately characterize the details on specific technologies,
   nor do they comprehensively cover all energy sectors, including energy
   conversion for non-energy products. We developed integrated assessment
   (IA) capabilities to allow stakeholders to observe the tradeoffs between
   various technology options and policy decisions and to test
   hypotheses/premises in a scenario-driven environment. The results of our
   analysis underscore the growing interconnection between water and energy
   in China, the mixed trade-offs from developing low-carbon technologies
   such as renewable energy and inland nuclear, and the importance of
   water-energy nexus issues at the regional and local scales. This study
   lays the groundwork for an integrated resource policy planning process
   in China and provides an assessment methodology and research directions
   for future studies of the water-energy nexus. Finally, this study
   contributes to the water-energy nexus literature by providing systematic
   data and policy implications for China, where data are typically less
   accessible, as well as providing references for other regions in the
   world that are facing similar water and energy use and planning
   challenges.}},

   support reliability planning in the US because they separately measure
   the effectiveness of actions to improve reliability made by the two
   distinct groups of firms (and their regulators or oversight bodies) that
   are responsible for planning and operating each portion of the US
   electric power system. The authors then present for the first time
   quantitative information on the reliability of each portion of the US

   average interruption duration index and the system average interruption

   between water-related sectors to be untangled while incorporating
   impacts of societal changes. We use a systems modelling approach to
   explore global change impacts on the nexus in the mid-21st century in a
   complexwestern Himalayanwater resource system in India, considering a
   range of climate change and alternative socio-economic development
   scenarios. Results show that future socio-economic changes will have a
   much stronger impact on the nexus compared to climate change. Hydropower
   generation and environmental protection represent the major
   opportunities and limitations for adaptation in the studied system and
   should, thereby, be the focus for actions and systemic transformations
   in pursue of the SDGs. The emergence of scenario-specific synergies and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT}},
Pages = {{1-25}},
Abstract = {{South Asia is energy-poor, water-stressed, and food-deficient, and these
   problems are expected to intensify with high population growth, rapid
   economic growth and industrialization, urbanization, and changing
   climate. Although the water, energy, and food security challenges are
   interconnected, they are dealt with in isolation, which fails to address
   the challenge of trade-offs and exacerbates the problems. The increased
   resource scarcity underlines the need for integrated solutions which
   ensure optimal resource use and maximize benefits. This article uses a
   nexus perspective to explore possible integrated solutions that support
   multiple uses of water at different scales and times. The analysis shows
   that the potential of water resources is underdeveloped and synergies
   between water, energy, and food are not fully harnessed. With proper
   coordination and management, water resources can generate multiple
   benefits for both upstream and downstream areas, including regional
   public goods such as regional connectivity and flood and drought

Abstract = {{Accurate identification of critical nodes and regions in a power grid is
   a precondition and guarantee for safety assessment and situational
   awareness. Existing methods have achieved effective static
   identification based on the inherent topological and electrical
   characteristics of the grid. However, they ignore the variations of
   these critical nodes and regions over time and are not appropriate for
   online monitoring. To solve this problem, a novel data-driven dynamic
   identification scheme is proposed in this paper. Three temporal and
   three spatial attributes are extracted from their corresponding voltage
   phasor sequences and integrated via Gini-coefficient and Spearman
   correlation coefficient to form node importance and relevance assessment
   indices. Critical nodes and regions can be identified dynamically
   through importance ranking and clustering on the basis of these two
   indices. The validity and applicability of the proposed method pass the
   test on various situations of the IEEE-39 benchmark system, showing that
   this method can identify the critical nodes and regions, locate the
   potential disturbance source accurately, and depict the variation of
   node/region criticality dynamically.}},

Title = {{Distributed State Estimation of Multi-region Power System based on
   Consensus Theory}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Effective state estimation is critical to the security operation of
   power systems. With the rapid expansion of interconnected power grids,
   there are limitations of conventional centralized state estimation
   methods in terms of heavy and unbalanced communication and computation
   burdens for the control center. To address these limitations, this paper
   presents a multi-area state estimation model and afterwards proposes a
   consensus theory based distributed state estimation solution method.
   Firstly, considering the nonlinearity of state estimation, the original
   power system is divided into several non-overlapped subsystems.
   Correspondingly, the Lagrange multiplier method is adopted to decouple
   the state estimation equations into a multi-area state estimation model.
   Secondly, a fully distributed state estimation method based on the
   consensus algorithm is designed to solve the proposed model. The
   solution method does not need a centralized coordination system
   operator, but only requires a simple communication network for
   exchanging the limited data of boundary state variables and consensus
   variables among adjacent regions, thus it is quite flexible in terms of
   communication and computation for state estimation. In the end, the
   proposed method is tested by the IEEE 14-bus system and the IEEE 118-bus
   system, and the simulation results verify that the proposed multi-area
   state estimation model and the distributed solution method are effective
   for the state estimation of multi-area interconnected power systems.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{419-440}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{PurposeIn the last years, India has taken a number of initiatives to
   boost small hydropower development based on the assumption of being a
   green energy source with only limited disturbances on the social and
   natural environments. However, its real environmental performances have
   not been examined. The intention of this paper is to evaluate the
   potential environmental impacts of Small Hydropower Plants (SHPs) in
   India in light of their exemption from any Environmental Clearance
   procedures.MethodsA cradle-to-use analysis of a SHP planned on the
   Kavery River in India was carried out using the GaBi Software and the
   ISO 14040 guidelines. The CML 2001, LANCA, and the methods developed by
   Chaudhary et al. (2015) were applied to characterize the impacts. This
   paper goes beyond conventional LCA and the sustainability paradigm of
   GHG emissions, by including a comprehensive evaluation of the impacts
   from land use and land use change in terms of their effects on
   terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity, on ecosystem services and in terms
   of biogenic GHG emissions. Sensitivity analyses of how predefined
   parameters affect the performances of the dam were also carried out.
   Further, a distance-to-target weighting factor based on the concept of
   Carrying Capacity was applied.Results and discussionFor the case study,
   depending on the impact category selected, the primary impacts are
   associated to the preconstruction, the construction, and the operation
   stages. These are the main contributors, in terms of impacts to
   ecosystem services, to biodiversity, and to global warming and
   eutrophication. As per material and energy inputs, concrete, steel, and
   electricity are the three dominating sources of impacts. The results of
   the sensitivity analysis suggest that the amount of organic matter
   washed into the reservoir as well as the plant output influence
   significantly the environmental performance of the dam. Based on the
   weighted results, Global Warming appears to be the most relevant impact
   with a relative contribution of 1.76E-14\% to the Global Carrying
   Capacity threshold.ConclusionThe study shows the need to account for a
   broader spectrum of environmental categories when assessing SHPs,
   underpinned by the significant impacts to biodiversity and ecosystem
   services as evidenced by the application of land use indicators. This
   can have long lasting consequences on the stability of a functioning
   ecosystem and its ability to provide valuable services. It also shows
   the need to reconsider the exemption of SHPs from any environmental
   impact assessment procedure.}},

Abstract = {{The active development and application of renewable energy, such as wind
   power and solar power, has become an inevitable tendency, which will
   promote the increase of the proportion of renewable energy generation
   accordingly in regional power grids. The intermission and randomness of
   renewable energy generation lead to enormous challenges in the operation
   and planning of power systems. One of the current methods to accommodate
   and reduce renewable energy fluctuation is conventional storage devices,
   e.g. battery energy storage devices, but this approach has the
   limitation of a high operating cost, which hinders the technology from
   popularizing. We present a novel load control algorithm employing the
   technology of residential thermostatically controlled appliances to
   maximize renewable energy usage in regional power grids. The thermal
   dynamics of the thermostatically controlled loads are modeled as a
   simplified first-order equivalent thermal parameter model. The new load
   control algorithm, based on the state-queueing model with modified
   colored power algorithm, is developed to manage activities of
   residential thermostatically controlled appliances, which allows
   customers to set different colors as the response levels of their
   appliances. Such an algorithm can ensure both the comfort level and the
   fairness of customers. Both a practical case and a real case are applied

Abstract = {{As one of the most developed provinces in China, Jiangsu province is

   Planning System (LEAP) model combined with plant-level data to study the
   impact of energy policies on water resources management. The results
   indicate that energy efficiency improvements and industry structure
   optimization can result in 40\% and 33\% water withdrawal savings
   respectively in the future depending on the level of optimization. With
   several integrated measures, total water use can meet the 2030 targets
   set by the Jiangsu provincial government. Shifts in cooling technology
   can bring significant water-savings benefits and help fulfill water
   use-control targets. Furthermore, we find that the Suzhou and Xuzhou
   administrative areas will experience power output efficiency reductions
   and will need more water in 2030 under the RCP45 and RCP85 scenarios.
   More efforts are needed to mitigate climate change and offset its

Abstract = {{Hydroelectric power plants are the most widely used renewable energy

   the turbine wheel. In this paper, soldering at the junctions of the
   stator windings in the central generators has been investigated.
   Traditional solder (Cu-Zn) materials and silver alloy solders (Ag-Cu-Zn)
   have been investigated in terms of thermal and metallographic. Silver
   alloy soldering has been found to have lower electrical conductivity
   than conventional soldering. The winding temperatures measured on the
   generating generator show that silver alloy soldering is more efficient.
   Reducing the stator winding temperature in hydroelectric power plants
   allows more energy production and also reduces costs by preventing
   winding failures.}},

Abstract = {{In India's Eastern Himalayan State of Sikkim, the indigenous Bhutia
   communities, Lachungpas and Lachenpas, successfully contested all
   proposed hydropower projects and have managed to sustain an anti-dam
   opposition in their home regions, Lachung and Lachen. In this paper, we
   discuss this remarkable, un-researched, effective collective action
   against hydropower development, examining how identity and territory
   influence collective action through production, creation and application
   of vernacular knowledge systems. The role of the Dzumsa, a prevailing
   traditional system of self-governance among the Lachungpas and
   Lachenpas, has been central in their collective resistance against large
   dams in Lachung and Lachen. Our findings show that contrary to popular
   imageries, the Dzumsa is neither an egalitarian nor a democratic
   institution-rather, it is an exercise of an ``agonistic unity{''}. The
   Dzumsas operate as complex collectives, which serve to politicize
   identity, decision-making and place-based territoriality in their
   struggle against internal and external threats. Principles of a
   ``vernacular statecraft{''} helped bringing the local communities
   together in imperfect unions to oppose modernist designs of hydropower
   development. However, while such vernacular institutions were able to
   construct a powerful local adversary to neoliberal agendas, they also
   pose high social, political and emotional risks to the few within the

Abstract = {{Energy and water resources are drawing increasing attention in China as
   indispensable elements of economic development and social stability.
   Energy production has led to widely debated issues such as water
   shortage and water pollution. Studies on their interrelation - i.e. the
   energy-water nexus - indicate that energy conservation impacts water
   resources. Energy conservation can bring synergy on water resources, but
   it is an unsettle issue to what degree energy conservation could
   indirectly protect water resources. In this work, we built an accounting
   framework to assess the synergy of energy conservation on both water
   quantity and quality at regional levels. Multiregional input-output
   (MRIO) analysis and economic parameters such as water price and
   treatment costs of water resources are applied to evaluate the value of
   synergy. The results show that Jiangsu saved the largest quantity of
   water with a volume of63.7 x 10(8)m(3), while Hunan achieved the largest
   reduction of wastewater with a volume of 3.2 x 10(8)m(3) during
   2007-2012. The total synergy was divided into two aspects: internal and
   external. The former was generally larger in most regions except
   Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Hainan, Shaanxi, Anhui and Inner Mongolia.
   The results of an economic assessment show that China achieved 1.1 x
   10(12) yuan of economic benefit through the synergy benefits from a
   holistic perspective. Jiangsu, Shanghai, Fujian, Shandong and
   Heilongjiang were primary beneficiaries due to their significant
   synergistic water saving and high shadow price of water resources. The
   proposed assessment framework may help understand the situation of
   regional resources conservation from both synergistic and economic
   perspectives. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the carbon reduction targets being set in the Paris Agreement on
   Climate Change, China is facing great pressure to meet its emission
   reduction commitment. The electric power industry as the major source of
   carbon emissions needs to be a focus. However, the uncertainty of power
   systems, the risk of reducing emissions and the fuzziness of carbon
   capture technology popularization rate and carbon reduction targets
   makes previous planning methods unsatisfactory for current planning.
   This paper establishes an interval fuzzy programming with a risk measure
   model which takes carbon capture technology and carbon reduction targets
   into account, to ensure that the complex electric management system
   achieves the best developmental state. It was concluded that in order to
   reduce carbon emissions, wind power and hydropower would be the best
   choices, and coal-fired power would be the suboptimal choice, and solar
   power would play a complementary role. Besides, decision makers should
   put much more effort into promoting and improving carbon capture
   technology instead of simply setting emission reduction targets. The
   non-synchronism of the downward trend in carbon emissions per unit of
   electricity generation and electric power industry total carbon

Abstract = {{A low-cost heat-exchanger system that can be used in
   high-pressure/low-pressure isolated solar water-heating systems in South
   Africa was developed for household applications. The combination of a
   copper coil and electrical heater allowed for isolation of the
   high-pressure and low-pressure sections of the system and enabled the
   utilisation of large low-cost solar heat-absorber platforms that
   operated at low pressure with a low risk of fouling and leaking. The
   design comprised a copper coil heat exchanger to be installed inside a
   conventional geyser, to replace the normal heating element and
   thermostat system in a conventional commercially available household
   geyser. The electric heating element still supplements the system in low
   solar energy conditions. The circulation in the system is created by a
   small separate photovoltaic panel and a circulation pump. An integrated
   switch allows the system to alternate between conventional electrical
   heating and solar water-heating according to prevailing weather
   conditions. Current tests show that the system of 15 m(2) area can be
   installed at a cost of approximately ZAR 10 000-12 000. The system can
   provide hot water at approximately 12 cents per kWh, with a total heat
   storage capacity of up to 10 kWh per day. This implies a saving to the
   customer of up to ZAR 600 per month. The accumulated saving to a
   household over the tenyear lifetime of the product is estimated at ZAR
   200 000. As the thermal energy storage capacity of current systems as
   available on the local market is approximately 1 kWh per day for a 2
   m(2) collector. A typical increase in thermal energy collection capacity
   of tenfold more than the capability of conventional systems on the
   market is hence achieved. The system offers implementation possibilities
   for South Africa's low-cost housing schemes and can provide for creating
   numerous new business and job opportunities on the African continent
   with its abundant solar irradiation resources.}},

Abstract = {{Norwegian hydropower has an excellent potential to balance power

   realistic potential for Norwegian hydropower to deliver flexibility is
   based on two pillars, adequate hydropower modelling and the sufficient
   geographical area covered in the model. Analyses are done with
   state-of-the-art models including a detailed description of cascaded
   water-courses with more than thousand reservoirs. Interoperability
   between hydropower and renewable energy sources is ensured as the entire
   European electricity generation from renewables with high geographic and
   temporal resolution is included in the study. To properly account for
   the full uncertainty of weather variables, many historic years of
   climate data are applied. The results show that without more flexibility
   in generation or demand, power prices become very volatile and show
   expedient periods with capacity deficit and curtailment of demand.
   Prices vary significantly both from hour-to-hour and from year-to-year.
   Increases in flexible hydropower provide large benefits to the system:
   significantly decreasing peak prices and reducing the involuntary

Abstract = {{In an independent regional power grid, the optimal coordination of
   renewable energy resources such as wind and solar becomes the key to

   wind-solar power and the long-term plan of hydropower. The objective of
   the work is to minimize the difference between the monthly water
   consumption of hydropower stations and the predicted, considering the
   constraints of water flow and daily average battery energy storage
   fluctuation. Because of the pessimistic attitude of dispatchers to
   forecasting results, a correction coefficient is used to modify
   forecasting outputs. Finally, simulation results show the advantages of
   the proposed optimal strategy over the strategy without optimal
   operation in ensuring the water level of reservoir, improving the

Abstract = {{The implementation of bulk energy storage (BES) technologies can help to
   achieve higher penetration and utilization of variable renewable energy
   technologies (e.g., wind and solar), but it can also alter the dispatch
   order in regional electricity systems in other ways. These changes to
   the dispatch order affect the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that
   is emitted to the atmosphere and the amount of total water that is
   required by the electricity generating facilities. In a case study of
   the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas system, we separately
   investigated the value that three BES technologies (CO2-Geothermal Bulk
   Energy Storage, Compressed Air Energy Storage, Pumped Hydro Energy
   Storage) could have for reducing system-wide CO2 emissions and water
   requirements. In addition to increasing the utilization of wind power
   capacity, the dispatch of BES also led to an increase in the utilization
   of natural gas power capacity and of coal power capacity, and a decrease
   in the utilization of nuclear power capacity, depending on the character
   of the net load, the CO2 price, the water price, and the BES technology.
   These changes to the dispatch order provided positive value (e.g.,
   increase in natural gas generally reduced CO2 emissions; decrease in
   nuclear utilization always decreased water requirements) or negative
   value (e.g., increase in coal sometimes increased CO2 emissions;
   increase in natural gas sometimes increased water requirements) to the
   regional electricity system. We also found that these values to the
   system can be greater than the cost of operating the BES facility. At
   present, there are mechanisms to compensate BES facilities for ancillary
   grid services, and our results suggest that similar mechanisms could be
   enacted to compensate BES facilities for their contribution to the
   environmental sustainability of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Three hydroelectric reservoirs (Kralkizi, Dicle and Batman) in the

   of CO2 (pCO(2)) and to estimate diffusive fluxes of CO2 from the
   reservoirs' surface water. pCO(2) concentrations did not show
   significant spatial differences, while they showed significant seasonal
   variations. Temperature, precipitation and biological CO2 uptake through
   photosynthesis controlled pCO(2) seasonality in the reservoirs, with
   maximal concentrations in the winter (ranging from 516.9 mu atm in
   Kralkizi to 1299.2 mu atm in Dicle) and minimal concentrations in the
   spring (ranging from 47.7 mu atm in Batman to 140.7 mu atm in Kralkizi).
   Most studies reported that reservoirs worldwide are net sources of CO2
   to the atmosphere. However, the reservoirs in this study were sinks for
   atmospheric CO2 during the spring, summer and autumn seasons, while they
   were CO2 sources to the atmosphere during the winter. Air-water CO2
   fluxes in Kralkizi, Dicle and Batman dam reservoirs were 2.39, 32.88 and
   8.12 mmol/m(2)/day in the winter, respectively. On an annual basis, all

Abstract = {{Increasing demand and the current unbalanced sectorial attribution of
   natural resources induce drastic depletion of natural capital. There is
   a need for bridging sectoral policies into interdisciplinary sustainable
   management strategies in the Mediterranean region. The complex
   interactions between ecosystems, food, energy, and water sectors are
   calling for an integrated approach for supporting impact assessments and
   decision-making. We aimed to investigate the coherence among the
   sectoral policies, either supporting or conflicting with each other, on
   cross-cuffing strategies and their impacts on ecosystem and their
   services. We address ecosystem services as a fourth component besides
   energy, water, and food sectors in the nexus approach. We collected
   expert opinions on eleven sectoral policies that cover different
   disciplines (water, agriculture, energy, economy, and environment).
   Based on the opinion of the experts, we developed several multi-criteria
   analyses (MCA) to assess sectoral policy impacts on cross-sectoral
   strategic targets. Considerable consistency was found in ranking the
   eleven policies when considering using nexus or cross-cuffing strategies
   criteria, or when considering positive or negative impacts. The EWFE
   nexus dimension allowed to better distinguish potential synergies or
   conflicts between sector policies because it provided a framework in
   which the role of ecosystem service was more explicit. Interestingly,
   restoring ecosystem and green infrastructures policy ranks among the top
   policies in all MCAs but according to the experts its probability of
   successful implementation is among the lowest. The results show that
   sustainable use of ecosystem services and conservation of the
   biodiversity are an indispensable pillar to achieve successfully

Abstract = {{China's water and energy sectors are both facing challenges induced by

   lowest of 72 million m(3) in Hainan. Concerning the energy for water,
   Jiangsu had the largest with 12.6 TWh, while Tibet ranked the lowest

Abstract = {{Since 2009, the Guobu landslide has been very active, posing a safety
   threat to the Laxiwa Hydropower Station, located only several hundred
   meters downstream along the upper Yellow River in China. To investigate
   the current state of this landslide, we analyzed two stacks of X-band
   TerraSAR-X (TSX) High-resolution Spotlight (HS) mode images acquired
   from September 2015 to April 2017 in descending orbits with different
   look angles. A new time-series point-like target offset tracking
   (TS-PTOT) method is proposed to retrieve time-series surface
   displacements at point-like targets (PTs) from SAR image pairs properly
   combined with large temporal baselines and small spatial baselines.
   According to an evaluation of the standard deviation of time-series
   displacements at stable points, the TS-PTOT method increased the
   measurement precision of offset tracking by about 25\% over the results
   using a single master. Our TSX-HS TS-PTOT results manifested a spatial
   pattern and magnitude of displacements highly similar to DInSAR result
   produced with an ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 image pair. The maximum displacement
   rate at the upper part of the slope during the study period was around
   80 cm/yr in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction, which is much lower than
   the displacement rate measured in 2010. Furthermore, three-dimensional
   (3D) displacements at those identified homologous PTs were estimated by
   combining two-dimensional (2D) displacements measured by TS-PTOT from
   the two SAR data stacks. The 3D deformation pattern of the Guobu
   landslide properly verified its toppling-sliding deformation mechanism.}},

   studied in deep tunnels of the Jinping-II Hydropower Station, China. The
   study is based on an analysis of 44 moderate and intense rockbursts
   which occurred during a period of more than a year of microseismic (MS)
   monitoring and relates to 11.6 km of tunneling. The results show that
   most of the cases are affected by structural planes regardless of the
   rockburst's moderate or intense character. The structural planes in the
   areas where rockbursts occur are mostly stiff ones and grade In or IV
   ones. In rockbursts development processes affected by structural planes,
   the MS energy proportion of big MS events, i.e. whose logarithm of MS
   energy (measured in Joules) is larger than 3.83, is comparatively lower.
   Structural planes change the way microseismicity evolves. Right from the
   beginning in the rockburst development and just before the rockburst
   affected by structural planes, there were some big MS events occurring.
   And structural planes cause rockbursts to occur more likely. Threshold
   values of the microseismicity (number of MS events and MS energy) for
   rockburst occurrence are relatively lower. In addition, the micro
   seismicity in rockburst development processes with different intensities
   and with/without structural planes shows discreteness and the
   microseismicity is greater in more intense rockbursts.}},

Abstract = {{A case study in the Solukhumbu region in northern Nepal reveals that the
   high number of seasonal tourists-which has doubled in 20 years- has led
   to growing water, food, and energy demands that have modified
   agropastoral practices and the use of local resources. This has induced
   new patterns in the movement of goods, people, and animals in the
   Everest region and the reconfiguration of the water-energy-food nexus.
   We use this concept of nexus to analyze ongoing interactions and
   transformations. Key changes involve (1) massive imports of consumer
   goods; (2) use of local resources with new techniques (hydropower
   plants, improved mills, greenhouses, and pipes for domestic networks)
   that depend on imported materials, which are newly accessible to Sherpas
   as a result of economic benefits generated by tourism; (3)
   commodification of local resources (water, hydropower, vegetables,
   fodder, and flour); (4) an increasing number of electrical appliances;
   and (5) new uses of water, especially for tourist-related services,
   including hot showers, watering of greenhouses, bottling of water, and
   production of electricity for cell phones, rice cookers, and other
   electric appliances. These new uses, on top of traditional ones such as
   mill operation. compete in some places during spring when water supplies
   are low and the tourist demand is high. A transfer of pressure from one
   resource (the forest) to another (water) has also resulted from the
   government ban on woodcutting, incentives to develop hydropower, and the
   competition between lodges to upgrade their amenities by offering better
   services (such as hot showers, plugs to recharge batteries, internet
   connections, and local vegetables). Our research finds that water is now
   central to the proper running of the tourist industry and the region's
   economy but is under seasonal pressure.}},

Abstract = {{The Blue Nile Highlands of Ethiopia are a densely populated,
   predominantly rural region dominated by smallholder crop-livestock mixed
   farming systems. Population growth, coupled with low productivity, have
   long posed a threat to natural forest ecosystems in the region, as trees
   have been removed for fuelwood and to clear area for grazing or crop
   production. In recent years, however, there has been a trend to replace
   cropland with eucalyptus plantations. This change has major implications
   for the hydrology, soils, and agricultural economy of the region. This
   study examines changes in tree cover for a highland area at the center
   of the Blue Nile Highlands. Landsat imagery from 1986 to 2017 is applied
   to characterize changing tree cover patterns over space and time. We
   find that total tree cover in this highland region has shifted
   dramatically over the past 30 years. Between 1987 and 1999 there was
   dramatic loss of tree cover, particularly in areas of natural vegetation
   at high and low elevation. This period coincided with the fall of the
   Derg government and the transition to the current political system. In
   the period since 1999 there has been an increase in tree cover, with
   rapid gains in recent years. This increase has taken two distinct forms:
   regrowth in previously forested areas, due in part to active
   conservation measures, and the establishment of eucalyptus plantations
   in mid-elevation zones. The ecological and economic implications of
   these two types of tree cover-protected forest vs. woodlot
   plantations-are quite distinct, with plantation forestry providing
   biomass energy at a cost to food production and water resources. Mapping
   cropland conversion to eucalyptus in recent years makes it possible to
   quantify the net impacts that this trend has had on local production of
   energy and food, and to estimate implications for water consumption.
   Effective monitoring of these changes is important for the ongoing
   development and implementation of effective land use policy in the
   region.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a model-based approach for assessing the impact of
   climate change on hydropower potential in the Nanliujiang River Basin of
   China. The variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrological model was
   proved to be able to do a good runoff simulation after 1000 times of
   calibration and validation, while it has greater uncertainty in the
   simulation of high flow and low flow. Coupling the VIC model with five
   climate models, the spatial and temporal distributions of water
   resources in the future are analyzed, and the uncertainty analysis shows
   that the multi-model ensemble results can more reliably reflect future
   climate change. Then, the hydropower potential of the whole river basin
   in the future is analyzed in order to allow for a more realistic picture
   of future hydropower planning. The results of this study indicate that,
   different degrees of future alterations in river discharge and the
   spatial and temporal distributions of water resources have to be
   expected, leading to an increase of 7.7\%-15.6\% in hydropower
   potentials under the scenario of RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Energy production typically consumes a large amount of fresh water,
   which is a critical resource for both human and ecosystem needs. Robust
   water impact analysis is prudent prior to deploying new energy systems
   at scale. While there are many water indices representing relative water
   availability (or scarcity), they are not suitable for analyzing the
   impact of consumptive water in the context of life-cycle analysis (LCA).
   The available water remaining (AWARE) concept, developed by the Water
   Use in LCA Group, enables global water impact analysis (AWARE-Global).
   However, while AWARE-Global enables consistent comparison
   internationally, it lacks the high spatial resolution and fidelity
   needed for decision-making at the local level regarding energy system
   deployment within the United States (U.S.). In this study, we developed
   an AWARE system for applications in the contiguous U.S. (AWARE-US) by
   incorporating measured runoff and human water use data at U.S.
   county-level resolution. Results of AWARE-US quantify the water stress

Abstract = {{Many countries have passed environmental laws aiming at preserving
   natural ecosystems, such as the Endangered Species Act of 1973 in the
   United States. Although those regulations seem to have improved
   preservation, they may have had unintended consequences in energy
   production. Here we show that while environmental constraints on
   hydropower may have preserved the wilderness and wildlife by restricting
   the development of hydroelectric projects, they led to more greenhouse
   gas emissions. Environmental regulations gave rise to a replacement of
   hydropower, which is a renewable, relatively low-emitting source of
   energy, with conventional fossil-fuel power, which is highly polluting.
   Our estimates indicate that, on average, each megawatt of fossil fuel
   power-generating capacity added to the grid because of environmental
   constraints on hydropower development led to an increase in annual
   carbon dioxide emissions of about 1,400 tons. Environmental regulations
   focusing only on the preservation of ecosystems appear to have
   encouraged electric utilities to substitute dirtier fuels for hydropower
   in electricity generation.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{391}},

Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Using a consumption-based Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) model, we
   investigate the distinctive characteristics, self-efficiency or external
   dependency, of energy demand's water footprint in China's two biggest
   and fastest developing megalopolises. We find that energy demand water
   footprint in the Jing-Jin-Ji and the Yangtze Delta amounted to 2.41 and
   9.59 billion m'of water withdrawal respectively in 2010, of which 848.06
   and 973.91 million rewas consumed. Among all energy products,
   electricity contributed the largest share to the energy sector's water
   footprint in both regions. The sectoral distribution of water footprint
   in the upstream supply chain differed by region. Most significantly, the
   agricultural sector accounted for more than 30\% of water consumption
   footprint. In addition to water used locally, final energy demands in
   these two regions induced external water footprint beyond their
   administrative boundaries. The Jing-Jin-Ji region's energy sector had a
   smaller water footprint compared to the water-abundant Yangtze Delta
   region. However, external water footprint occupied a larger proportion
   in the former. Such divergence can be attributed to the distinctive
   water endowments and water-using technologies utilized in their
   respective energy sectors. Bespoke urban governance and policies
   tailored to local resource and technology portfolios are recommended for
   different urban agglomeration energy and water flows.}},

Abstract = {{The world food price crisis in 2007/08 has aroused worldwide attention

   This paper modelled the entire environment of food production and

   order to reveal the hidden connections related to the food
   self-sufficiency issue, including the interdependencies of food
   production with its restraining factors (hybrid energy, hybrid water),

   all direct and indirect flows in the FEW nexus and projected a potential
   Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) to figure out the impacts of policies on
   FEW nexus flows, nexus robustness, total input of all sectors, and
   household expenditures in Japan and China. The results show that the
   pattern of food-related extraction flows was more imbalanced than the
   pattern of hybrid energy flows, due to the high dependence of Japan on
   the food supply of China (16.11\% of total food-related extractions). An
   ETS may increase Japan's total household expenditure on imported goods
   from China in the fields of sugar refining (1.3096\%), processing

Abstract = {{Stability assessment of rock slopes in hydropower engineering regions is
   an important and complex issue. Rock mass classification systems are a
   good approach because they can thoroughly consider many factors
   influencing rock slope stability. The slope stability probability
   classification (SSPC) system is a novel method. However, it has two
   limitations when applied to rock slopes: 1) it is only suitable for
   slopes less than 45 m in height, and 2) there is great subjectivity and
   randomness in the estimation of intact rock strength. Therefore, this
   study presents two modifications of the SSPC system by adopting the
   Hoek-Brown strength criterion and an empirical formula for maximum slope
   height. Evaluation of results from of 34 typical rock slopes of the
   major hydropower engineering regions in China indicated that the
   accuracy rate of the modified SSPC for stability evaluation of these
   slopes was 61.8\%, and the accuracy for stability evaluation of 10
   slopes with non-structural control failure was 80\%. The stability
   values of stable and unstable slopes obtained using the modified SSPC
   were different to those obtained using the Chinese Slope Mass Rating
   (CSMR) and modified CSMR systems. In addition, the identification
   accuracy rate of the modified SSPC was significantly higher than that of
   the CSMR and modified CSMR. Therefore, the modified SSPC can be applied
   to hydropower engineering regions, providing a new means of rapidly
   evaluating the slope stability of high rock slopes (slopes > 45 m in
   height) in these regions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the monthly operations of an interprovincial
   hydropower system (IHS) connected by ultrahigh voltage direct current
   lines. The IHS consists of the Xiluodu Hydropower Project, which ranks
   second in China, and local plants in multiple recipient regions. It
   simultaneously provides electricity for Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces
   and thus meets their complex operation requirements. This paper develops
   a multi-objective optimization model of maximizing the minimum of total
   hydropower generation for each provincial power grid while considering
   network security constraints, electricity contracts, and plant
   constraints. The purpose is to enhance the minimum power in dry season
   by using the differences in hydrology and regulating storage of multiple
   rivers. The TOPSIS method is utilized to handle this multi-objective
   optimization, where the complex minimax objective function is
   transformed into a group of easily solved linear formulations.
   Nonlinearities of the hydropower system are approximatively described as
   polynomial formulations. The model was used to solve the problem using
   mixed integer nonlinear programming that is based on the
   branch-and-bound technique. The proposed method was applied to the
   monthly generation scheduling of the IHS. Compared to the conventional
   method, both the total electricity for Guangdong Power Grid and Zhejiang
   Power Grid during dry season increased by 6\% and 4\%, respectively. The
   minimum monthly power also showed a significant increase of 40\% and
   31\%. It was demonstrated that the hydrological differences between
   Xiluodu Plant and local hydropower plants in receiving power grids can
   be fully used to improve monthly hydropower generation.}},

Abstract = {{Power systems play a crucial role in people's lives. To ensure the

   a node's ability to affect its neighbor nodes' operation state, is
   defined. Then, considering both the level and direction of power flow on

   system, a coupling tracking rank algorithm is proposed to identify the
   correlation between the failure of nodes and transient state of the

Abstract = {{The ocean interacts with the atmosphere via interfacial exchanges of
   momentum, heat (via radiation and convection), and fresh water (via
   evaporation and precipitation). These fluxes, or exchanges, constitute
   the ocean-surface energy and water budgets and define the ocean's role
   in Earth's climate and its variability on both short and long
   timescales. However, direct flux measurements are available only at
   limited locations. Air-sea fluxes are commonly estimated from bulk flux
   parameterization using flux-related near-surface meteorological
   variables (winds, sea and air temperatures, and humidity) that are
   available from buoys, ships, satellite remote sensing, numerical weather
   prediction models, and/or a combination of any of these sources.
   Uncertainties in parameterization-based flux estimates are large, and
   when they are integrated over the ocean basins, they cause a large
   imbalance in the global-ocean budgets. Despite the significant progress
   that has been made in quantifying surface fluxes in the past 30 years,
   achieving a global closure of ocean-surface energy and water budgets
   remains a challenge for flux products constructed from all data sources.
   This review provides a personal perspective on three questions: First,
   to what extent can time-series measurements from air-sea buoys be used
   as benchmarks for accuracy and reliability in the context of the budget
   closures? Second, what is the dominant source of uncertainties for
   surface flux products, the flux-related variables or the bulk flux
   algorithms? And third, given the coupling between the energy and water
   cycles, precipitation and surface radiation can act as twin budget
   constraints-are the community-standard precipitation and surface
   radiation products pairwise compatible?}},

Abstract = {{China's energy bases suffer from serious water shortages. To analyse the
   energy-water nexus under China's Nationally Determined Contribution
   (NDC) and the Well Below 2 Degrees (WBD2) target with a more detailed
   spatial resolution, a five-region China TIMES-W model incorporating
   water issues is developed. The results show the following: 1) Strict
   climate targets will require significant increases in non-fossil energy
   use. 2) Water withdrawal for energy use in the energy bases is expected
   to be 9.8 billion m(3) in 2050 in the WBD2 scenarios. The increased
   water withdrawal will mainly be caused by the deployment of

   power plants, the water withdrawal for which will be 5.5 billion m(3).
   3) The carbon intensities for the power sector will be in the range of

Volume = {{215}},
Pages = {{758-765}},

Abstract = {{Damming rivers to generate electricity creates a lentic environment that
   favors methylmercury (MeHg) formation. Reservoirs in the Amazon are
   critical environments for MeHg formation, considering its old soils and
   the use of Hg in gold mining in the region. The objective of this study
   was to evaluate MeHg accumulation in three environmental compartments
   (aquatic macrophytes, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediment)
   of the Samuel reservoir (Western Amazon, Brazil), during the low water,
   ebb and high water hydrological periods, characterizing the dry season,
   the end of the rainy season and the rainy season, respectively. MeHg
   concentrations were determined through GC-AFS. The aquatic macrophytes
   presented higher \%MeHg in their roots (up to 12\%) compared to their
   other tissues. This ratio was 1.7 and 5.9 times higher than those
   observed for SPM and the sediment, but MeHg concentrations were the
   lowest (0.5-4.5 ng g(-1)) among the three environmental compartments.
   Contrary, the highest MeHg concentration was observed in SPM (104 ng
   g(-1)) during the low water period. The MeHg concentration in the
   sediment profile decreased with increasing depth (0.93-0.48 ng g(-1))
   and with decreasing organic matter lability (increasing C:N ratio). In
   the SPM, on the other hand, MeHg concentration showed a positive
   association with increasing C:N ratio. We conclude that MeHg dynamics in
   the SPM are associated with the hydrological periods, with peaks during
   the low water period. The organic matter lability of the sediments is
   more limiting to the production of MeHg than the total Hg
   concentrations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change and hydropower operations affect hydrological regimes at
   regional basin scales and impact hydrodynamics and habitat conditions
   for biota at the river reach scale. The present study proposes a
   hierarchical modeling framework for predicting and analyzing the impacts
   of climate change and hydropower on fish habitats. The approach couples
   multi-scale climate, hydrological, water temperature, hydrodynamic and
   habitat suitability models and was applied to a reach of the Jinsha
   River. Flow discharge and water temperature were predicted in the study
   area for a baseline scenario and three climate change scenarios, and
   each considered the presence and absence of impacts caused by hydropower
   operation. The impacts of flow discharge and water temperature
   variations on spawning and juvenile Coreius guichenoti, an imperiled
   warm-water fish in the Jinsha River Basin (JRB), were evaluated using a
   fuzzy logic-based habitat model. The results showed that habitat
   suitability and available usable area for the fish increased due to
   climate change, and water temperature rising was the main influencing
   factor. Water temperature decrease induced by hydropower operation in
   the spawning periods resulted in the reduction of available habitat
   area. However, climate change reduced the negative effects generated by
   hydropower operation, and the available habitat area for the fish would
   still be expected to increase under the combined impacts of climate
   change and hydropower operation in the future. It is predicted that
   water warming, as a result of climate change, is likely to eliminate the
   spawning postponement effect generated by hydropower operation on
   Coreius guichenoti as well as other warm-water fish species in the JRB.
   In contrast, water warming induced by climate change is likely to
   exacerbate the negative effects of hydropower operation on the spawning
   activity of cold-water fish species in the JRB. The present study
   provides a scheme to predict the impacts of climate change and
   hydropower on other organisms in river ecosystems. The results are

Title = {{Governing the Water-Energy-Food Nexus Related to Hydropower on Shared
   Rivers-The Role of Regional Organizations}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{An evolving literature on the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus argues that
   there is a need to better understand the conditions under which nexus
   coordination may occur. A case in point are hydropower investments on
   shared rivers which might impact the provision of energy, water and food
   security across borders. In international basins, governing the WEF
   nexus impacts of hydropower relies on voluntary negotiations between the
   respective countries involved. It has been argued that such negotiations
   may be facilitated by regional organizations, such as international
   river basin organizations (IRBOs), but this claim has hardly been
   investigated systematically. Drawing on regime theory in international
   relations and the literature on benefit sharing, this paper asks what
   role regional organizations may play in governing hydropower-related WEF
   nexus impacts. It compares three cases of hydropower planning on shared
   rivers. The Rusumo Falls and the Ruzizi III hydropower projects (HPPs)
   are joint investments in Africa's Great Lakes region facilitated by an
   IRBO and a regional energy organization, respectively. On the Mekong,
   Laos is constructing the Xayaburi dam despite reservations by the Mekong
   River Commission and downstream riparians. The paper finds IRBOs and
   regional energy organizations may play a role in facilitating
   cross-border nexus governance by supporting benefit-sharing arrangements
   and by fostering the application of environmental and social safeguards
   and international law principles. However, it also shows that the
   influence of regional organizations varies, and how successfully they
   support nexus governance also depends on whether the HPP is planned
   unilaterally or jointly; the availability and consensus on data on nexus
   impacts; and the presence or absence of donors and private sector
   capital and investors.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by biofuel policies, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions and increase domestic energy supply, global production and
   consumption of bioethanol have doubled between 2007 and 2016, with rapid
   growth in corn-based bioethanol in the U.S. and sugar cane-based
   bioethanol in Brazil. Advances in crop yields, energy use efficiency in
   fertilizer production, biomass-to-ethanol conversion rates, and energy
   efficiency in ethanol production have improved the energy balance and
   GHG emission reduction potential of bioethanol. In the current study,
   the water, energy, and carbon footprints of bioethanol from corn in the
   U.S. and sugar cane in Brazil were assessed. The results show that U.S.
   corn bioethanol has a smaller water footprint (541 L water/L bioethanol)
   than Brazilian sugar cane bioethanol (1115 L water/L bioethanol).
   Brazilian sugar cane bioethanol has, however, a better energy balance
   (17.7 MJ/L bioethanol) and smaller carbon footprint (38.5 g CO(2)e/MJ)
   than U.S. bioethanol, which has an energy balance of 11.2 MJ/L
   bioethanol and carbon footprint of 44.9 g CO(2)e/MJ. The results show
   regional differences in the three footprints and highlight the need to
   take these differences into consideration to understand the implications
   of biofuel production for local water resources, net energy production,

Abstract = {{Northern China's plantations have long played a role in providing
   ecological services to the people of China. Reliable detection and
   attribution of ecosystem water and energy exchange is a precondition to
   the development of strategies for the sustainable management of these
   plantations. Here, the seasonal and interannual variability in surface
   energy exchange and evapotranspiration (ET) over a young pine plantation
   was investigated using eddy-covariance measurements collected over a
   four-year period (2012-2015). Seasonal patterns in net radiation (R-n),
   latent (LE) and sensible heat fluxes (H) were largely similar over the
   four years. H was the dominant energy component, with LE exceeding H
   only during the mid-growing season. A significant share of R-n was
   allocated to H during the 2014 summer drought. Energy exchange for the
   young pine plantation was characterized by high Bowen ratios (beta =
   H/LE; 6.28, 6.42, 5.65, and 5.34 for the four years), high H/R-n (0.37,
   0.36, 0.36, and 0.30), and low LE/R-n (0.15, 0.17, 0.17, and 0.16), with
   mean annual values of 5.92, 0.35, and 0.16 for beta, H/R-n, and LE/R-n,
   respectively. Daily maximum and annual ET were 4.8, 4.5, 4.1, and 3.3 mm
   day(-1) and 328, 371, 290, and 326 mm for the four years, with a mean
   annual value of 329 mm. Seasonal variation in ET was strongly controlled
   by biological factors (i.e., bulk surface conductance and vegetation
   greenness and density, as characterized by the normalized difference
   vegetation index) regulated by soil water availability and water vapor
   pressure deficit (VPD). Evapotranspiration varied interannually and the
   evapotranspiration-to-precipitation ratio (ET/P) ranged from 0.79 to
   1.62. Soil water replenishment through precipitation during the non
   growing period of the previous year and mid-growing season of the
   current year was responsible for the interannual variation observed in
   ET. These results clearly indicate the importance of precipitation
   timing and soil moisture carry-over from previous years in controlling
   ecosystem energy and water vapor exchange. Irrigation during the spring
   and dry periods of the year is highly favorable for growth of plantation
   trees in northern China.}},

Abstract = {{With the increase of renewable energy permeability and the development

   transmission, distribution and retail, and the feed-in tariff and retail
   prices of electricity are regulated by government. It is difficult to
   analyze the application value of energy storage for China's electricity
   due to the lacking of data. The major contribution of this paper is to
   evaluate the application value according to the data of a provincial

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Globally, freshwater is unevenly distributed, both in space and time.
   Climate change, land use alteration, and increasing human exploitation
   will further increase the pressure on water as a resource for human
   welfare and on inland water ecosystems. Water transfer megaprojects
   (WTMP) are defined here as large-scale engineering interventions to
   divert water within and between river basins that meet one of the
   following criteria: construction costs >US\$ 1 billion, distance of
   transfer >190 km, or volume of water transferred exceeds 0.23 km(3) per
   year. WTMP represent an engineered solution to cope with water scarcity.
   These projects are most commonly associated with large-scale
   agricultural and energy development schemes, and many of them serve
   multiple purposes. Despite numerous case studies that focus on the
   social, economic, and environmental impacts of individual water transfer
   megaprojects, a global inventory of existing, planned and proposed
   projects is lacking. We carried out the first comprehensive global
   inventory of WTMP that are planned, proposed or under construction. We
   collected key information (e.g., location, distance, volume, costs,
   purpose) on 34 existing and 76 future (planned, proposed or under
   construction) WTMP. If realized, the total volume of water transferred
   by future projects will reach 1,910 km3 per year with a total transfer
   distance of more than twice the length of the Earth's equator. The
   largest future WTMP are located in North America, Asia, and Africa and
   the predicted total investment will exceed 2.7 trillion US\$. Among
   future projects, 42 are for agricultural development, 13 for hydropower
   development and 10 combine both purposes. Future megaprojects are also
   planned to support mining, ecosystem restoration and navigation. Our
   results underscore the extent to which humans have and are planning to
   re-engineer the global hydrological network and flows through WTMP,
   creating a network of ``artificial rivers.{''} They emphasize the need
   to ensure the inclusion of these projects in global and basin
   hydrological models, and to develop internationally agreed criteria to
   assess the ecological, social and economic impacts of WTMP.}},

Abstract = {{Synergistic effects between water and energy policies are still not
   fully considered in Shaanxi province of China. To address the challenges
   of water scarcity and growing energy demand, the water-energy nexus of
   Shaanxi is investigated in this paper by input-output analysis (IOA).
   The findings indicate that water and energy resources are interdependent
   on each other. It is observed that agricultural water use intensity is
   0.28 m(3) per USD and industrial water use intensity is at the lowest
   level of 0.013 m(3). Therefore, there is a huge water saving potential
   in the agricultural sector. Owing to the high energy consumption in
   agricultural irrigation, reducing irrigation water is of benefit both
   for water saving and energy conservation in the agricultural sector.
   Meanwhile, the industrial sector accounts for 63.8\% of total energy
   consumption in Shaanxi, and it is urgent to change the economic
   structure to service-based rather than agricultural or industrial
   activities. It is believed that integrated strategies and planning are
   more favored in the future in Shaanxi. Water use limitation, energy mix
   adjustment and pricing mechanisms should be involved in water and energy
   policy formulation. Remarkably, because of being low carbon and water
   saving, the natural gas industry will become increasingly promising in

Abstract = {{Food processing industries consume intensive water and energy to produce
   food products. However, their water and energy data are scarce and
   require for good measurement approaches. This study presents data
   collection and analysis of process-level water and energy use in a
   large-size U.S. beef packing plant through a combined use of portable
   and in-line meters and theoretical calculations. The kill floor and
   plant cleaning are the primary water users, accounting for 28.7 and
   24.0\%, respectively. The refrigeration compressor system is the largest
   user of electricity, consuming 24.5\% of plant-wide electricity. Heating
   of water for plant cleaning and food safety purposes is the largest
   thermal energy use in summer (81\%) and second-largest in winter
   (49.7\%), with unit heating values of 625 and 666MJ/ton live cattle
   weight in the summer and winter, respectively. Twice as much thermal
   energy is used in the winter than summer due to space heating
   requirements. A regression analysis found that as outdoor temperatures
   increased, a slight water use increase and larger energy use decrease
   were observed.
   Practical applicationsCurrently available data on water and energy use
   in the U.S. beef packing industry are scarce, thus limiting the ability
   to develop new water and energy efficient technologies and policies

   of the experiment, maize growth parameters, yield attributes, yield, and
   water- and energy-use efficiency were highest at fixed plots under ZT.
   Maize growth parameters were significantly (P < 0.05) superior under ZT

Abstract = {{Tibet and the Sichuan-Yunnan Tibetan area have enormous potential for

   Tibet and Sichuan-Yunnan Tibetan areas; eventually, the water resources
   therein can be more effectively utilised. Research has indicated that
   drafted preferential policies can effectively decrease the cost price.
   Additionally, the hydropower industry in these areas should be
   incorporated into the national primary energy balance, forming a

   four hydrological stations (Lin Jia Cun (LJC), Xian Yang (XY), Lin Tong

   Fu's equation) represent land surface changes; climate variability
   comprises precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (ET0). All
   the stations showed a reduction in annual runoff during the recording

   change and 1.97\% to 53.32\% by climate variability. In the Weihe River
   basin, land surface changes drive runoff variation in LT and climate
   variability drives it in LJC, XY, and HX. The contribution of land
   surface changes to runoff reduction in period I was less than that in
   period II, indicating that changes in human activity further decreased
   runoff. Therefore, this study offers a scientific basis for
   understanding runoff trends and driving forces, providing an important
   reference for social development, ecological construction, and water

   Linking Water, Energy and Food}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Increasing agricultural productivity has always been a prominent feature
   on the regional agenda due to a high incidence of food and nutrition
   insecurity. This review assessed the current status of irrigated
   agriculture in southern Africa from a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus
   perspective. Gaps and opportunities for improving irrigated agriculture
   within the context of the WEF nexus were also assessed in terms of the
   feasible limits to which they can be exploited. Southern Africa faces
   water scarcity, and climate projections show that member states will
   face increased physical and/or economic water scarcity by as early as
   2025, which will have negative impacts on water, energy and food
   production. Recurrent droughts experienced across the region reaffirm
   the sensitive issues of food and energy insecurity as well as water
   scarcity. Projections of an increasing population within the region
   indicate increased water, energy and food demand. With agriculture
   already accounting for about 70\% of water withdrawals, increasing the
   area under irrigation will place additional demand on already strained
   energy grids and scarce water resources. This poses the questionis
   increasing irrigated agriculture a solution to improving water access,
   food security and energy supply? While there are prospects for
   increasing the area under irrigation and subsequent improvement in
   agricultural productivity, adopting a WEF nexus approach in doing so
   would mitigate trade-offs and unintended consequences. Consideration of
   the WEF nexus in integrated resources planning and management eliminates
   the possibilities of transferring problems from one sector to other, as
   it manages synergies and trade-offs. While it is acknowledged that
   improving water productivity in irrigated agriculture could reduce water
   and energy use while increasing yield output, there is a need to decide
   how such savings would then be reallocated. Any intervention to increase
   the irrigated area should be done in the context of a WEF nexus
   analytical framework to guide policy and decision-making. Technical
   planning should evolve around the WEF nexus approach in setting targets,
   as WEF nexus indicators would reveal the performance and impact of
   proposed interventions on any of the three WEF nexus components.}},

Abstract = {{A unified policy framework for energy and water would be beneficial
   considering the high interdependence the two resources in China. In this
   paper, a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model is
   established to examine the existence of synergetic effects within water
   fee policy and energy related climate policy, i.e. carbon tax, and
   provide insights for Chinese integrative policy-making. The results show
   that water fee can contribute to industrial water conservation, whereas
   its effect is limited under current water fee level. The adoption of a
   carbon tax in addition to it might further improve its water saving
   benefits. Furthermore, water fee can also promote the enhancement of
   China's emission reduction goal, and a higher carbon tax and water fee
   rate can achieve greater emission reduction effects. At this point, the
   synergetic spillover effects that water conservation benefits will be
   achieved simultaneously via the transition of industry into a more
   low-carbon form is critical for elaborating an effective strategy of
   environmental policy. Besides, our results suggest that giving priority
   to renewable power is regarded as the silver bullet to address the water

Abstract = {{An understanding of factors modulating water and energy fluxes
   partitioning over vegetated surfaces is important in a context of global
   environmental changes. The study evaluated the patterns of water vapour
   and energy fluxes to enable the development of biome scale predictive
   evapotranspiration (ET) models over the Albany thicket vegetation.
   Environmental constraints to ET were assessed by examining the response
   of ET to biotic and abiotic factors with the latter accounting for >50\%
   variability in ET. Bulk parameters were used to evaluate the integrated
   impact of biophysical factors on fluxes. The surface conductance (G(s))
   for use in the Penman-Monteith equation and the Priestley-Taylor
   coefficient (alpha) for application in the modified Priestley-Taylor
   model were modelled as a function of environmental variables. A
   predictive ET equation developed for the area was validated. On an
   annual scale, 62\% of net radiation was consumed by sensible heat flux,
   and alpha was <1, indicating that the area was water limited. The
   decoupling factor (0.005) suggested strong connection between the canopy
   and the boundary layer. The patterns of ET and vapour pressure deficit
   suggest strong ET control through stomatal conductance. The prediction
   of ET as a function of leaf area index and reference evapotranspiration
   was better able to simulate observed ET (root mean square error {[}RMSE]
   0.28 mm day(-1)) than application of the Penman-Monteith equation using
   modelled G(s) (RMSE of 0.59-0.62 mm day(-1)) when average ET was 0.87 mm
   day(-1). The modified Priestley-Taylor equation did not perform well
   because ET was strongly coupled to vapour pressure deficit and surface

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper performs a multi-model comparison to assess strategies for
   adaptation to climate change impacts in hydropower generation in Brazil
   under two Representative Concentration Pathways. The approach used
   allows for evaluating the interactions between climate change mitigation
   and adaptation strategies under low and high impact scenarios through
   2050. Climate change impact projections of sixteen General Circulation
   Models indicate that a global high emissions trajectory scenario would
   likely yield more severe impacts on hydropower generation than a
   mitigation scenario. Adaptation modeling suggests that climate change
   impacts can be compensated by a wide range of alternatives, whose
   optimality will depend on the level of mitigation effort pursued. Our
   results show that climate change impacts would lead to even higher
   emissions in the absence of climate change mitigation policies. On the
   other hand, mitigation strategies to pursue lower emissions are
   maintained under climate change impacts, meaning that mitigation
   strategies are robust when faced with adaptation challenges. Mitigation
   efforts could yield a more diverse and less carbon intensive mix of
   technological options for adaptation. When analyzing investment costs to
   adapt to climate change impacts, in some cases mitigation can lead to a
   lower total investment level. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Given the need for transformative changes towards more sustainable,
   integrated management of water, energy and food systems, the
   water-energy-food nexus concept seems highly relevant. However, while
   intuitively compelling, the nexus has also been criticized for
   abstracting and thereby dis-embedding the collaboration processes
   through which further integration could be achieved. There is a lack of
   empirical analysis and context-sensitive understanding, of the
   opportunities and constraints of, collaboration and cross-sector
   coordination, as faced by actors governing interconnected water, energy
   and food systems. In this paper we analyse how actors involved in the
   governance of water, energy and food systems are embedded in social
   networks, and discuss how that embeddedness shapes collaboration and
   coordination processes that are relevant for addressing interconnected
   sustainability challenges. Drawing on the notion of problernsheds, we
   delineate an analytical space that captures the interactions between
   water, energy and food systems and the actors influencing them in the
   Upper Blue Nile of Ethiopia. Our empirical data suggest that the claim
   that actors from different sectors are disconnected from each other is
   overly simplistic. The ways in which actors are embedded in hierarchical
   structures may help to explain why coordination challenges persist,
   despite the presence of cross-sectoral linkages among them.}},

Abstract = {{The interrelation of the water-energy-food nexus and processes of
   globalization has to be understood thoroughly in order to address
   socio-economic inequalities and environmental change. However,
   unravelling the complexities of the water-energy-food nexus in the
   context of globalization poses conceptual and empirical difficulties.
   Economic globalization, e.g. through transnational trade and foreign
   direct investment, results in a global conjunction of actors, interests
   and impacts, strongly affecting patterns of resource extraction and
   environmental degradation, and local capabilities for its governance. In
   environmental economic geography, the global value chain and global
   production networks approaches have proved useful for the analysis of
   interrelations between governance structures, value, institutional
   contexts, and modes of resource consumption. In this paper, we discuss
   the potential of the global production networks approach to analyze
   society-environment relations in the context of the water-energy-food
   nexus and processes of globalization. To make our argument, we will use
   the case of manure and digestate, which results from meat and bioenergy
   production in the Oldenburger Munsterland, the center of livestock
   farming in Germany. The region is Germany's best developed agribusiness
   cluster, which is integrated into a transnational network of animal
   producers, feedstuff producers and meat processors. And it is also home
   to many biogas plants and several market leaders in bioenergy
   technology, strongly related to the livestock husbandry business. The
   case is an example of the three-way-mutual interactions among food,
   energy and water. The analysis will combine the perspective of the
   water-energy-food nexus with the analytical categories of the global
   production networks approach to provide a nuanced understanding of the
   socio-environmental implications of the global integration of a regional
   agri-food production cluster.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change might impact various components of the bulk electric

   advance the understanding of how climate change might impact the bulk
   U.S. power system in three ways. First, we synthesize recent research to
   capture likely component-level impacts of climate change in the United

   power system planning and operations. Third, we outline an agenda for
   future research on climate change impacts on power system planning and

   collectively they might significantly affect planning and operations.
   Most notably, increased demand plus reduced firm capacity across
   generation types might require systems to procure significant additional
   capacity to maintain planning reserve margins, and regional declines in
   renewable resources might need to be offset by increasing zero-carbon
   investment to meet decarbonization targets. Aggregated impacts might
   also affect operations, e.g., through shifts in dispatching and

   Comparisons between the baseline and the proposed model yields an output

Abstract = {{The sustainability of the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus is a significant
   challenge faced by developing countries, especially China. Evaluating
   the sustainability status of China's water-energy-food, and improving
   its sustainable use, may provide good physical conditions to support
   China's future development. This paper applied the Pressure, State, and
   Response (PSR) model to select evaluation indexes. A combination
   weighting method was used to combine two objective weighting methods to
   determine index weights. The study constructed the classical field, the
   limited field, and the matter-element to be evaluated. This allowed the
   establishment of an improved matter-element extension model to evaluate
   the sustainability of the water-energy-food nexus; the model was then
   used to quantitatively evaluate the sustainability of China's
   water-energy-food nexus. The simulation results indicated that in 2005,
   the sustainability of China's water-energy-food was at a relatively low

   significantly improved between 2005 and 2015; however, the improved
   sustainability remained at a general status (The general status means
   that the sustainability of water-energy-food nexus in China can meet the
   basic development needs, but it is far from the optimal state and needs
   further adjustment and improvement). Thus, China should improve its
   current utilization patterns for the three resources and consider them
   as a whole. This would help realize synergistic resource use and enhance
   their sustainability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Industry is a large electricity user. China's chemical industry
   (globally the largest based on sales) contributes 7\% to China's GDP,
   while it consumes 11\% of the total electricity consumption in industry
   and is responsible for 40\% of total CO2eq, 40\% of SO2, 59\% of NOx and
   18\% of PM-emissions of the chemical industry emissions. The
   heterogeneity of GHG and air pollutant emissions across electricity
   grids (within a country) is rarely included in analyses. In this paper,
   electricity conservation supply curves are developed (distinguishing the
   grids) to estimate the cost-effective and technical potentials of
   electricity conservation in China's chemical industry. The emission
   factors per grid for GHG (i.e. CO2, CH4 and N2O) and air pollutants
   (i.e. SO2, NOx and PM2.5) are calculated and used to quantify the
   emissions mitigation achieved by electricity saving technologies in the
   chemical industry for the period 2012-2035. Results show that
   significant multiple benefits can be obtained by implementing
   electricity efficiency measures. There are large differences among the
   six grids in terms electricity savings and emissions abatement of GHG
   and air pollutants. 83\% of the total electricity saving potential is
   contributed by the North, Northwest and Central grids, equal to 32\% of
   baseline electricity consumption in 2035. In 2035, 129 Mt of CO2, 33 kt
   CO2eq of CH4, 571 kt CO2eq of N2O, 235 kt of SO2, 275 kt of NOx and 52
   kt of PM2.5 in these three grids can be avoided as a result of
   electricity savings (a reduction of 31-33\% compared to baseline
   emissions). When decision-makers set targets for energy saving and
   emission reduction, the multiple benefits and grid heterogeneity should
   not be ignored.}},

Title = {{Applying the water-energy-food nexus to farm profitability in the Middle
   Breede Catchment, South Africa}},
Journal = {{SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{114}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The water-energy-food nexus has emerged as a useful concept to
   understand the multiple interdependencies that exist between the water,
   energy and food sectors. The nexus is an ambitious attempt to work
   across disciplines and scales to understand the workings of these
   complex systems. It is, however, criticised for being more of a general
   framework than a practical methodology because of the vast amount of
   data it would need to make real-life contributions to sustainable
   development. We show how the nexus approach, when used within a farm
   budget model, can transform the problem focus in water governance. By
   changing the relationship among water, energy and food production of a
   farm, profitability is significantly changed. The water-energy-food
   nexus debate is discussed within the context of the South African water
   sector, particularly the Breede River Catchment. Working from within the
   farm budget model, we demonstrate the impact of moving from an
   irrigation canal system that requires electricity for pumping, to a
   gravity-fed piped irrigation system in the Middle Breede River. The
   finding is that the water-energy-food nexus has the potential to unlock
   groundbreaking solutions to complex problems in agricultural water
   management when used in appropriate modelling systems.
   Significance:
   The water-energy-food nexus approach can lead to an entirely new framing
   of water governance problems and therefore solutions to these problems.
   The water-energy-food nexus when used in farm budget models can identify
   ways of altering farm profitability.
   By addressing the energy cost of farming through an irrigation pipeline
   system in parts of the Breede Catchment Area, farm profitability could
   significantly increase.
   A gravity-fed closed pipeline system in parts of the Breede River can
   improve water availability and reduce farm and management costs.}},

Title = {{Comprehensive evaluation of the stability of the left-bank slope at the
   Baihetan hydropower station in southwest China}},

Abstract = {{The stability of the left-bank slope is a crucial geological engineering
   problem at the Baihetan hydropower station, China. Due to continuous
   excavations on the rock slope, different regions of the surrounding rock
   mass undergo varying degrees of unloading deformation. It is important
   to assess the stability of the rock slope from a macroscopic viewpoint
   by investigating its deformation characteristics and mechanisms.
   Therefore, in this work, microseismic (MS) monitoring was first employed
   to detect the progressive rock mass damage in the rock slope subjected
   to excavation, including the initiation, propagation, coalescence, and
   interaction of rock microfractures. Numerical modeling was subsequently
   performed to understand the deformation and failure mechanism of the
   rock slope. Moreover, traditional surveying approaches (i.e.,
   multiple-point extensometers and inclinometers) and field observations
   were also used to analyze the deformation and failure characteristics of
   the rock slope. The MS monitoring results showed that spatiotemporal
   regularities in the evolution of seismic source locations were
   indicators of deformation failure and potential sliding surfaces. MS
   event clustering can be used to delineate activated pre-existing
   geological structures (i.e., LS331 and LS337). The simulation results
   show that the deformation and failure characteristics of the rock slope
   are mainly controlled by pre-existing weak structural planes (i.e., the
   intraformational faulted zones LS3319, LS331, and LS337 and fault F17).
   These results agree well with the results of geological data and
   conventional monitoring data. Our study reveals that an integrated
   approach combining MS monitoring, numerical modeling, traditional
   surveying, and field observations leads to a better understanding of the
   behavior of the rock slope under the influence of excavation as well as
   greater control of the working faces, ensuring safety under complex
   geological and excavation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Sub-Saharan Africa has been at the epicenter of an ongoing global
   dialogue around the issue of energy poverty. More than half of the
   world's population without access to modern energy services lives there.
   It also happens to be a sub-continent with plentiful renewable energy
   resource potential. Hydropower is one of them, and to a large extent it
   remains untapped. This study focuses on the technical assessment of
   small-scale hydropower (0.01-10 MW) in Sub-Saharan Africa. The
   underlying methodology was based on open source geospatial datasets,
   whose combination allowed a consistent evaluation of 712,615 km of river
   network spanning over 44 countries. Environmental, topological, and
   social constraints were included in the form of constraints in the
