Title = {{Optimal allocation of hydropower and hybrid electricity injected from
   inter-regional transmission lines among multiple receiving-end power
   grids in China}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{444-452}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{In China, due to the unbalanced distribution of energy center and load
   center, numerous transmission projects are built to improve the national
   energy allocation efficiency and the external electricity is playing an
   increasing important role in the daily operation of receiving-end grids.
   The current fixed proportion method for energy allocation is relatively
   simple and easy to implement, but may produce unreasonable energy
   injection with the features of a straight line or ``anti-peak
   regulation{''} in some cases, increasing the peak operation pressure of
   power systems. Thus, it is of great necessity to further improve the
   allocation scheme of inter-regional transmitted electricity among
   receiving-end power grids. As a new contribution to the research field,
   this paper develops a mixed integer linear programming model with the
   goal of minimizing the weighted peak-valley difference of multiple
   remaining load curves to address this problem. The presented model is
   applied to the East China Power Grid, and the results show that the
   presented model can obtain satisfying results in reducing the peak loads
   of multiple power grids. For instance, in the long-term simulations, the
   presented model can make about 23.7\%, 5.9\%, 5.7\% and 8.3\% reductions
   in the maximum loads of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui,
   respectively. Then, it can be concluded that optimizing the allocation
   of inter-regional transmitted electricity will be a viable way to reduce
   the peak operation pressure of multiple receiving-end power grids in
   China. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   with weak interlayer zone in underground intersecting chambers: A case

Abstract = {{A weak interlayer zone (WIZ) is a rock mass system with poor mechanical
   properties, large-scale random distribution, water softening, causing an
   adverse effect on the safety of the construction and project progress.
   To investigate the fracture process and the mechanism of rock masses
   with WIZs in the intersecting chambers during the excavation process, in
   situ microseismic (MS) monitoring was carried out in the underground
   powerhouse on the right bank of the Baihetan Hydropower Station, China.
   During the monitoring, the spatio-temporal evolution process of the
   microseismicity of the rock masses around the intersecting chambers was
   obtained during the excavation unloading of multiple working faces. The
   spatial evolution of MS events illustrates the dynamic progressive
   characteristics of MS activities as they propagate and accumulate along
   the WIZ and finally form a cluster zone. The fracture mechanism of
   moment tensor inversion reveals the distribution and evolution of MS
   events with respect to different fracture types: Tensile fracture events
   are distributed near the free surface while non-tensile fracture events
   are far from the free surface. Finally, the study proposes support
   measures restraining fracture development in surrounding rock masses
   with WIZ. The effectiveness of reinforced support measures is verified
   by MS events and the deformation of surrounding rocks. The results of
   the study are particularly valuable for the stability analysis,
   excavation, and support optimization of similar engineering studies.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},

Volume = {{245}},
Pages = {{258-265}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{This study performs a statistical analysis on shear strength parameters
   of rock mass for hydropower projects in China. First, a large database
   comprising 1139 groups of field direct shear tests on rock mass from 100
   hydropower projects in China is compiled. Second, the best-fit
   probability distributions of shear strength parameters are identified
   using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Finally, new characteristic
   and design values of shear strength parameters of rock mass are
   suggested. The results indicate that shear strength parameters increase
   with increasing quality of rock mass. In particular, the shear strength
   parameters of discontinuities in rock mass are significantly smaller
   than those of rock mass itself. The discontinuities in rock mass should
   be paid more attention during geological investigations. There is a
   large variation in shear strength parameters, and the variability of
   cohesion is larger than that of tangent of friction angle. The derived
   statistics of shear strength parameters of rock mass in this study
   provide an update to the values suggested in Chinese codes, and serve as
   a reference for hydropower projects with few site-specific test data and
   similar geological conditions for partial-factor design of dams.}},

Title = {{Robust hydroelectric unit commitment considering integration of

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{228}},
Pages = {{1341-1352}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid generation of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) power together with
   hydropower offers a promising option to promote the integration of PV
   power, because hydro units can complement variable PV generation rapidly
   at relatively low cost. However, the strong variations in PV generation
   create uncertainties for the operation of the hydro units. To improve
   guidelines for large-scale hydro PV plant operation, a stochastic hydro
   unit commitment model considering the uncertainty in forecasting PV
   power is presented. This model seeks robust solutions (i.e., hydro unit
   status) to minimize the hydro plant's water consumption when external
   load demands are imposed onto the hybrid system. A two-layer nested
   optimization framework is proposed to solve the model in a hierarchical
   structure. In the outer layer, a cuckoo search algorithm, combined with
   a novel encoding strategy, optimizes the number of online units that can
   meet the load demand under all PV generation processes. In the inner
   layer, load dispatch schemes for the given number of online units are
   determined by dynamic programming. China's Longyangxia hydro PV plant
   was selected as a case study. Operational results were compared for
   three scenarios: actual operation, deterministic operation without
   consideration of PV forecast errors, and stochastic operation with
   consideration of PV forecast errors. The results indicate that: (1) the
   encoding strategy can handle the minimum online and offline time
   constraints, and can decrease optimization dimensionality; (2) the
   two-layer nested optimizer can make robust and effective decisions
   within an acceptable period when using the pre-stored optimization
   results provided by dynamic programming; and (3) water consumption in
   deterministic and stochastic operation scenarios decreased by 1.5\% and
   1.0\%, respectively, compared to that of actual operation. These
   findings verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed
   methods, and also highlight the importance of decreasing uncertainty in
   the PV power forecast.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, Chinese government has determined to guide the energy
   structure adjustment. The rapid development of hydropower is still
   important for the low-carbon transition. Therefore, we established a
   scenario-based system dynamics model considering emission trade scheme
   (ETS) and government policy. 4 scenarios (No ETS \& policy; Only ETS;
   Only policy; Both ETS \& policy) were established to investigate the
   development path of hydropower in China. In 2030, the installed-capacity
   of conventional hydropower will reach 364.2, 416.1, 428.7 and 470.5
   million kW under four scenarios; and the installed capacity of
   pumped-storage power will be 75.8, 85.6, 95.5 and 100.8 million kW under
   four scenarios. Note that, the development paths of installed-capacity
   and power generation of pumped-storage power and conventional hydropower
   are characterized by oblate ``S-shaped{''} curves. By analyzing the
   differences between scenario 2 (Only ETS) and scenario 3 (Only policy),
   we can conclude that the effect of policy support on the development of
   hydropower is larger than the ETS. The conclusions derived from
   sensitivity analysis show that the changes in policy intensity have
   greater impact than changes in ETS price. In brief, all the results and
   discussions can help Chinese government shape a development plan for
   hydropower generation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The frequent recent drought events in the Great Plains of United States

   Using an integrated water-food-energy nexus modelling and optimization

   monitoring with real-time irrigation management. The proposed
   water-food-energy simulation and optimization method is spatially
   explicit and was applied to one major corn region in Nebraska. The crop
   simulations, validated with yield statistics, showed that a drought year
   like 2012 can potentially reduce the corn yield by 50\% as compared to a
   wet year like 2009. The simulation results show that irrigation can play
   a key role in halting crop losses due to drought and in sustaining high
   yields of up to 20 t/ha. Nevertheless, the water-food-energy
   relationship shows that significant investments on water and energy are
   required to limit the negative effects of drought. The multi-criteria

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is a complex and cross-cutting problem that needs an
   integrated and transformative systems approach to respond to the
   challenge. Current sectoral approaches to climate change adaptation
   initiatives often create imbalances and retard sustainable development.
   Regional and international literature on climate change adaptation
   opportunities and challenges applicable to southern Africa from a
   water-energy-food (WEF) nexus perspective was reviewed. Specifically,
   this review highlights climate change impacts on water, energy, and food
   resources in southern Africa, while exploring mitigation and adaptation
   opportunities. The review further recommends strategies to develop
   cross-sectoral sustainable measures aimed at building resilient
   communities. Regional WEF nexus related institutions and legal
   frameworks were also reviewed to relate the WEF nexus to policy.
   Southern Africa is witnessing an increased frequency and intensity in
   climate change-associated extreme weather events, causing water, food,
   and energy insecurity. A projected reduction of 20\% in annual rainfall
   by 2080 in southern Africa will only increase the regional
   socio-economic challenges. This is exacerbating regional resource
   scarcities and vulnerabilities. It will also have direct and indirect
   impacts on nutrition, human well-being, and health. Reduced agricultural
   production, lack of access to clean water, sanitation, and clean,
   sustainable energy are the major areas of concern. The region is already
   experiencing an upsurge of vector borne diseases (malaria and dengue
   fever), and water and food-borne diseases (cholera and diarrhoea). What
   is clear is that climate change impacts are cross-sectoral and
   multidimensional, and therefore require cross-sectoral mitigation and
   adaptation approaches. In this regard, a well-coordinated and integrated
   WEF nexus approach offers opportunities to build resilient systems,
   harmonise interventions, and mitigate trade-offs and hence improve
   sustainability. This would be achieved through greater resource
   mobilisation and coordination, policy convergence across sectors, and
   targeting nexus points in the landscape. The WEF nexus approach has
   potential to increase the resilience of marginalised communities in
   southern Africa by contributing towards attaining the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 13).}},

Abstract = {{Water shortage can constrain energy development and use, and climate
   change partially caused by energy consumption can profoundly affect the
   quantity and distribution of water resources worldwide. The chronic
   water shortage in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China is likely to
   worsen under the impact of global climate change. The coal-dominated
   electricity sector will continuously have a high water demand. This
   reality will intensify the dilemma between water supply and power
   generation. This paper presents an adaptability analysis of the
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in 2013-2030 based on the current
   situation. Water evaluation and planning and long-range energy
   alternative planning systems are used to simulate changes in water and
   energy systems, respectively, and the impacts on the electricity sector
   under two climate scenarios and three development scenarios. On this
   basis, this study explores the potential of power structure adjustment
   and technological advancement in easing baseline water stress and
   promoting sustainable development in the region. Findings show that the
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is under high water stress, which will be
   aggravated under global climate change. In representative concentration
   pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, the baseline water stress of
   the region in 2017-2030 averages 259\% and 494\%, and the annual unmet
   water demand reaches 15.3 and 21.1 billion m(3), respectively. In the
   renewable energy and advanced technology scenarios, the regional water
   savings are expected to reach 200-250 million m(3) by 2030. The unmet
   water demand of power generation can be alleviated to some extent, but
   the water shortage trend cannot be reversed. Therefore, the
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region should develop an overall plan and layout
   of energy and water resources and adopt a combination of policy
   instruments to support the expansion of renewable energy or promote

Abstract = {{Water, energy and food are the basic resources for human survival and
   development. The coordination development of water-energy-food (W-E-F)
   is of great significance to promote regional sustainable development. In
   this study, Northwest China (Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang)
   was selected as the research case, and an evaluation index system was
   constructed to assess the vulnerability and coordination of
   water-energy-food (W-E-F) system based on PSR model. Then, a coupled
   model based on cloud-matter element model and coordination degree model
   was proposed. The cloud-matter element model was adopted to evaluate the
   vulnerability level of W-E-F system. The coordination degree model was
   employed to calculate the coordination degrees of W-E-F system. The
   results showed that, from 2006 to 2015, the vulnerability levels of
   W-E-F system in Northwest China were mostly at Level 1. The coordination
   degrees of W-E-F system belonged to the transitional development level
   (II) in most years. The vulnerability and coordination problems of W-E-F
   system in Northwest China were severe. The comprehensive vulnerability
   index values of W-E-F system were generally on the rise, but far from
   reaching a good level. Moreover, the comprehensive vulnerability index
   values and coordination degrees of W-E-F system in Northwest China do
   not match well. Finally, the countermeasures and suggestions to improve
   the coordinated development of water resource, energy and food in
   Northwest China were put forward.}},

Abstract = {{Towns and cities worldwide emit significant pollution and are also

   United States, Canada, and Mexico to 100\% wind, water, and sunlight
   (WWS) in all energy sectors by no later than 2050, with at least 80\% by

   heat; using electricity, solar heat, or geothermal heat for water and
   air heating in buildings; storing electricity, cold, heat, and hydrogen;
   and providing all electricity and heat with WWS. This full transition in
   the 53 towns and cities examined may reduce 2050 air pollution premature

Abstract = {{As important subsystems of the urban environment, water resources and
   energy are necessary for normal urban functions and play an important
   supporting role in urbanization. The rapid development of China's
   economy is increasingly dependent on these two subsystems. Analyses of
   the relationship between urbanization and water use or energy
   consumption have become the focus of attention, but researchers have
   mainly evaluated the impact on the two subsystems separately without
   providing an integrated analysis, nor have they revealed the link
   between water use and energy consumption. We addressed this information
   gap by using an econometric method to empirically investigate the
   long-term equilibrium relationships and Granger causal relationships
   among urbanization, water use, and energy consumption in China, and by
   conducting a spatiotemporal analysis to identify the trends of water use
   intensity and energy consumption intensity under the effects of
   urbanization during 2005-2015. We found long-term equilibrium
   relationships among urbanization, water use, and energy consumption.
   Granger causality results reveal the presence of a unidirectional
   Granger causal relationship running from urbanization to energy
   consumption and to water use, and bidirectional causality between energy
   consumption and water use. Moreover, water use intensity and energy
   consumption intensity decreased significantly under urbanization during
   the study period.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the development of a new bottom-up large-scale
   hydroeconomic model, Extended Continental-scale Hydroeconomic
   Optimization (ECHO), that works at a subbasin scale over a continent.
   The strength of ECHO stems from the integration of a detailed
   representation of local hydrological and technological constraints with
   regional and global policies, while accounting for the feedbacks between
   water, energy, and agricultural sectors. In this study, ECHO has been
   applied over Africa as a case study with the aim of demonstrating the
   benefits of this integrated hydroeconomic modeling framework. Results of
   this framework are overall consistent with previous findings evaluating
   the cost of water supply and adaptation to global changes in Africa.
   Moreover, results provide critical assessments of future investment
   needs in both supply- and demand-side water management options, economic
   implications of contrasting future socioeconomic and climate change
   scenarios, and the potential trade-offs among economic and environmental
   objectives. Overall, this study demonstrates the capacity of ECHO to
   address challenging research questions examining the sustainability of
   water supply and the impacts of water management on energy and food
   sectors and vice versa. As such, we propose ECHO as useful tool for
   water-related scenario analysis and management options evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{To realize the safety control of electric power systems under high

   irradiance (GHI) forecasts using numerical weather prediction models
   (NWP) are becoming increasingly important. The objective of this study
   is to understand meteorological characteristics pertaining to large
   errors (i.e., outlier events) of GHI day-ahead forecasts obtained from
   the Japan Meteorological Agency, for nine electric power areas during
   four years from 2014 to 2017. Under outlier events in GHI day-ahead
   forecasts, several sea-level pressure (SLP) patterns were found in 80
   events during the four years; (a) a western edge of anticyclone over the
   Pacific Ocean (frequency per 80 outlier events; 48.8\%), (b) stationary
   fronts (20.0\%), (c) a synoptic-scale cyclone (18.8\%), and (d) typhoons
   (tropical cyclones) (8.8\%) around the Japanese islands. In this study,
   the four case studies of the worst outlier events were performed. A
   remarkable SLP pattern was the case of the western edge of anticyclone
   over the Pacific Ocean around Japan. The comparison between regionally
   integrated GHI day-ahead forecast errors and cloudiness forecasts
   suggests that the issue of accuracy of cloud forecasts in high- and
   mid-levels troposphere in NWPs will remain in the future.}},

Title = {{Study on Added-Value Sharing Ratio of Large EPC Hydropower Project Based
   on Target Cost Contract: A Perspective from China}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) has been applied in
   China's hydropower projects for its value-added advantages compared with
   traditional project delivery systems in theory. However, the actual
   performance of large EPC hydropower projects has been challenged by the
   complexity of the stakeholders' interest demands and conflicts. The
   increasing use of target cost contracts (TCC) in the construction
   industry has provided a pain/gain share mechanism for the owners to
   incentivize contractors to complete projects within cost budgets. The
   added-value sharing ratio is the core element of TCC, and it
   predetermines how much proportion of savings the contractor can get paid
   if the actual cost is below the target cost, and how much proportion of
   overspend the contractor has to pay if the actual cost is higher than
   the target cost. In this paper, we consider the added-value sharing
   ratio under the framework of TCC based on the principal-agent theory,
   and look at how the added-value sharing ratio is influenced by various
   factors and how it affects the owner and the contractor in large EPC
   hydropower projects. Determination of the added-value sharing ratio in
   both discrete and continuous conditions are discussed, respectively. It
   is found that the added-value sharing ratio is relatively explicit in
   the discrete case, while the optimal added-value sharing model in the
   continuous case is more complex, which can be used to analyze the
   relationship between the added-value sharing ratio and the key
   influencing factors. Our research conclusions can provide both
   theoretical guidance and practical suggestions to contract design in the
   implementation of EPC hydropower projects, to some extent.}},

   current situation in Switzerland, the water tower of Western Europe, we
   particularly address the issues of water rights, resource rents and

   hydropower companies with shared private and public ownership; i.e., if
   external stakeholders are also sensitive shareholders who grant, at the
   same time, the company the right to operate. Altogether, this

Abstract = {{An area of discolored water 50 m wide and 30 m long was found in
   September 2017 close to the dam of the Irkutsk hydroelectric power
   station. Water from this spot was sampled for investigation in the
   present study. Microscopic analysis revealed that the suspended matter
   in the sample was composed of clumps of filaments, vegetative cells,
   akinetes and heterocysts that formed short filaments and solitary cells.
   This matter was found to consist of partially degraded cells of the
   cyanobacterium Dolichospermum lemmermannii. Nucleotide sequencing of DNA
   isolated from the biomass revealed the presence of the sxtA gene which
   is involved in the synthesis of saxitoxin. Water from the polluted area
   contained 600 +/- 100 mu g L-1 saxitoxin as measured by HPLC-MS with
   pre-column modification of the toxin with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine.
   Immunoassay analysis (ELISA) showed a concentration of saxitoxins in the
   water of 2900 +/- 900 mu g L-1. Hydrochemical and microbiological
   analyses suggested the contaminated area appeared as a result of a D.
   lemmermannii bloom, followed by its decay and release of saxitoxin and
   nutrients. The present paper describes the results of a case study.
   Better understanding of the phenomenon will depend on the possibility to
   perform implementation of a large-scale monitoring program.}},

Abstract = {{Water use and energy consumption are strongly interwoven in networks of
   economic activity. Tracking energy and water flows among regions and
   quantifying their interdependencies are fundamental for synergetic
   management of these two essential resources. In this work, we built an
   accounting framework to assess the performance of energy-water nexus
   networks within China. Water consumption for various energy types and
   energy consumption in all stages of water use were inventoried for
   different regions. Then, direct and indirect energy and water embodied
   in monetary flows among regions were calculated via multiregional
   input-output analysis to build an embodied energy network, embodied
   water-related energy network, embodied water network, and embodied
   energy-related water network. Finally, a set of ecological network
   analysis indices were used to analyze the properties and connection of
   these four networks. The results show disparities of water-related
   energy/total energy ratios among regions and the nexus impact on
   regional energy and water systems. Beijing and Shanghai have large
   ratios of final demand consumption because of their large population and
   rapid economic development. Embodied water and energy consumption in
   capital stock in Hainan, Ningxia represented 15\% of total consumption
   by booming investments. We found that embodied water was transferred
   from western to eastern regions and northern to southern regions. Major
   energy export-import pairs were Xinjiang-Shanghai, Hebei-Beijing,
   Xinjiang-Zhejiang, and Jiangsu-Shanghai. Regions with controller/relier
   roles in the network were identified in the context of nexus impact, for

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted to compare water productivity of short-
   and long-duration rice cultivars transplanted on different dates under
   variable irrigation regimes during 2012-2014. The experiment was laid
   out in split plot design keeping combinations of three dates of
   transplanting (15 June, 25 June and 5 July) and two cultivars (PR 115
   and PR 118) in main plots and four irrigation regimes {[}irrigation at
   1, 2 and 3days after infiltration of ponded water (DIPW) and continuous
   ponding (CP)] in subplots. Crop transplanted on June 15 and 25 produced
   statistically similar but significantly higher grain yield than July 5
   transplanted crop. Grain yield increased to the tube of 17.2 and 15.6\%
   under early transplanting on June 15 and 25 compared to July 5,
   respectively. However, amount of irrigation water applied decreased by
   23.6 and 12.9cm for July 5 and June 25 transplanted crop compared to
   June 15 transplanted crop, respectively. Apparent crop water
   productivity (ACWP) and total crop water productivity (TCWP) were
   significantly higher in June 25 transplanted crop than in June 15 and
   July 5. Similarly, energy use efficiency and energy productivity were
   also the highest in June 25 transplanted crops followed by June 15 and
   the least in July 5. Significantly higher grain yield was observed in
   cultivar PR 118 as compared to PR 115 under June transplanting dates (15
   and 25 June). However, reverse trend was observed in late transplanting
   on July 5. Significant reduction in grain yield of PR 118 was recorded
   with delay in transplanting from June 25 to July 5, but PR 115 performed
   statistically similarly under all the three dates of transplanting.
   Irrigation water applied was 9.4\% higher in PR 118 as compared to PR
   115. ACWP and TCWP were 7.9 and 9.2\% higher in PR 115 than in PR 118,
   respectively. ACWP and TCWP of PR 115 increased with delay in
   transplanting from June 15 to July 5, but differences between June 25
   and July 5 remained nonsignificant. However, in the case of PR 118, ACWP
   and TCWP remained statistically similar between June 15 and June 25 and
   thereafter decreased significantly with delay in transplanting to July
   5. Rice grain yield did not show any significant effect on irrigation
   application frequency, i.e. irrigate continuously or applied water at 1,
   2 and 3 DIPW. However, 5.9, 15.2 and 23.5\% higher irrigation water
   applied was recorded in continuous ponding than in irrigation
   application at 1, 2, and 3 DIPW, respectively. Apparent water
   productivity and energy use efficiency were 5.9 and 7.0, 15.3 and 13.0,
   and 19.8 and 23.0\% higher in irrigation scheduling at 1, 2 and 3 DIPW

   landfills and promoting alternative management practices to produce
   energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Anaerobic digestion
   and composting are organic waste treatment alternatives, however, both
   practices require careful management to prevent similar environmental
   impacts as landfills. A model was developed to assess the impact of
   anaerobic digestion followed by composting of food waste and green waste
   mixtures on net energy production, global warming potential and scarce
   water use. The model included the ability to vary the initial organic
   waste composition, decomposition kinetics and treatment time. Energy
   needs for composting aeration and water pumping, and water use decreased
   as anaerobic digestion time increased. Composting water use savings for
   an organic waste anaerobically digested for 90 days prior to composting
   compared to zero days prior to composting ranged between 25\%-53\% for
   different organic waste compositions (from 1:0 to 0:1 green waste to
   food waste ratios), and energy use savings for composting aeration and
   water pumping ranged between 15\%-17\% and 24\%-54\%, respectively, for
   the same conditions. For an anaerobic digestion pretreatment time of 30
   days prior to composting, the analysis predicted scarce water use to be
   0.31-1.09 in m(3) SWe/Mg waste, primary energy use to be -168.5-298.3
   MJ/Mg waste, and global warming potential to be 8.1-26.4 kg CO(2)e/Mg
   waste. The results will help inform the design and maintenance of waste
   treatment in resource-limited environments.}},

Abstract = {{The eddy covariance method is a powerful technique for quantification of
   CO2, H2O and energy fluxes in natural ecosystems. Leaf area index (LAI)
   and its changes are significant drivers of CO2 and H2O exchange in a
   forest ecosystem due to their role in photosynthesis. The present study
   reports the seasonal variation CO2 of and energy fluxes and their
   relationship with other meteorological parameters of a semi-evergreen
   primary forest of Kaziranga National Park, Assam, India during February
   2016-January 2017. The diurnal pattern of half hourly average CO2 fluxes
   over the forest was found to be mostly dominated by the incident
   photosynthetically active radiation. During the period of study, diurnal
   variations of CO2 flux showed a maximum value of -9.97 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)
   in the month of June during summer which is also the beginning of the
   monsoon season. The monthly averaged diurnal CO2 flux and variation in
   LAI of the forest canopy closely followed each other. The annual net
   ecosystem exchange of the forest estimated from the flux data above the
   canopy is 84.21 g C m(-2)yr(-1) . Further studies are in progress to
   confirm these findings. The estimated average annual evapotranspiration
   of the semi-evergreen forest is 2.8 +/- 0.19 mm day(-1) . The study of
   partitioning of energy fluxes showed the dominance of latent heat fluxes
   over sensible heat fluxes. The energy balance closure was found to
   increase with an increase in instability and the highest closure of
   around 83\% was noted under neutral conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Most cities import energy and water from their hinterlands. Both the
   nexus in a city and that between the city and its hinterlands should be
   considered for comprehensive management of water and energy. To examine
   the water-energy nexus associated with the city embedded in the
   hinterland, a city-hinterland water-energy mixed-unit input-output
   methodology is proposed to model the effects of growth under different
   water and energy production and consumption scenarios based on the
   growth of the demands for water and energy resources from the city. This
   study presents a demonstration of the water-energy mixed-unit
   input-output approach by analyzing Hong Kong and its associated
   hinterland in mainland China. A Sankey diagram and several indicators
   have been presented to illustrate the water-energy nexus in 2015, as
   well as the nexus for future city growth and the nexus incorporating the
   water and energy infrastructures planned in Hong Kong. Several
   indicators in the results compare the interaction between water and
   energy systems and the dependence on hinterland for different scenarios
   in Hong Kong. The modeling outcomes show that the current water
   infrastructures might be able to meet the demand for water treatment in
   2050. The indicators obtained from this study suggest that all types of

Abstract = {{Under the increasing crisis of a worldwide watershed water shortage and

   the water-carbon nexus of a biomass energy plant, this study calculates
   the water-carbon nexus of a hydropower plant, which represents the water
   utilization amount per unit greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. The water
   utilization of a hydropower plant is composed of absolute water
   evaporation loss and temporary water storage loss. For the Zhikong
   hydropower plant in Tibet, 0.704 m(3) of water is utilized when achieves
   a unit kg GHG reduction, and 0.126 m(3) of water is evaporated when
   keeps a cubic meter of water in reservoir storage. With regards to the
   accumulated water-carbon nexus, a biomass energy system is more
   efficient in achieving a GHG reduction than the Zhikong hydropower plant
   in the first three years of operation, but thereafter the Zhikong
   hydropower plant is more efficient. The water-carbon nexus has
   identified a new direction for allocating watershed water resources to

Abstract = {{Water availability is a major factor constraining humanity's ability to
   meet the future food and energy needs of a growing and increasingly
   affluent human population. Water plays an important role in the
   production of energy, including renewable energy sources and the
   extraction of unconventional fossil fuels that are expected to become
   important players in future energy security. The emergent competition
   for water between the food and energy systems is increasingly recognized
   in the concept of the ``food-energy-water nexus.{''} The nexus between
   food and water is made even more complex by the globalization of

   virtual transfer of water among regions and plays an important role in
   the food and water security of some regions. This review explores
   multiple components of the food-energy-water nexus and highlights
   possible approaches that could be used to meet food and energy security
   with the limited renewable water resources of the planet. Despite clear

Abstract = {{By the end of this century higher temperatures and significantly reduced
   rainfall are projected for the Brazilian North and Northeast ( NE)
   regions due to Global Warming. This study examines the impact of these
   long-term rainfall changes on the Brazilian Northeast's hydroelectric
   production. Various studies that use different IPCC models are examined
   in order to determine the average rainfall reduction by the year 2100 in
   comparison to baseline data from the end of the 20th century. It was
   found that average annual rainfall in the NE region could decrease by
   approximately 25-50\% depending on the emissions scenario. Analysis of
   historical rainfall data in the Sao Francisco basin during the last 57
   years already shows a decline of more than 25\% from the 1961-90
   long-termaverage. Moreover, average annual rainfall in the basin has
   been belowits long-termaverage every year bar one since 1992. If this
   declining trend continues, rainfall reduction in the basin could be even
   more severe than the most pessimistic model projections. That is, the
   marked drop in average rainfall projected for 2100, based on the IPCC
   high emissions scenario, could actually eventuate before 2050. Due to
   the elasticity factor between rainfall and streamflow and because of
   increased amounts of irrigation in the Sao Francisco basin, the
   reduction in the NE's average hydroelectric production in the coming
   decades could be double the predicted decline in rainfall. Conversely,
   it is estimated that wind power potential in the Brazilian NE will
   increase substantially by 2100. Therefore both wind and solar power will
   need to be significantly exploited in order for the NE region to
   sustainably replace lost hydroelectric production. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Water and energy are basic resources for urban development. It is of
   extreme importance to balance economic development, water and energy
   security, and environmental sustainability at the city level. Although
   many studies have focused on energy-related CO2 emissions or water
   resources, individually, in relation to socioeconomic development, few
   studies have considered water and energy-related CO2 emissions as
   synchronous limiting factors. Here, taking Beijing as an example, a
   partial least squares STIRPAT modela method that combines partial least
   squares with the STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on
   population, affluence, and technology) modelwas used to determine the
   main driving factors of water use and energy-related CO2 emissions at
   the regional scale from 1996 to 2016. The empirical results showed that
   the population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP), urbanization
   level, technology level, and service level, are all important factors
   that influence the total water use and energy-related CO2 emissions.
   Additionally, eight scenarios were established to explore suitable
   development modes for future years. Consequently, a medium growth rate
   in socioeconomic status and population, and a high growth rate in the
   technology and service level, were found to be the most appropriate
   development modes. This scenario would result in a total water use of
   4432.13 million m(3) and energy-related CO2 emissions of 173.64 million
   tons in 2030. The results provide a new perspective for decision makers
   to explore suitable measures for simultaneously conserving water

Abstract = {{China has been undergoing unprecedented urbanization since the 1978
   economic reform, with the present growth rate of 20 million people per
   year. This rapid and perennial progress has been raising concerns about
   environmental sustainability, due to a severe nationwide deterioration
   of China's environment and ecosystems in the context of ceaselessly
   increasing demand for water and energy. It is therefore of prime
   necessity and importance to comprehend China's water and energy security
   under the effect of dramatic demographic changes. Analyses of this issue
   still remain few and far between, and a comprehensive picture is not
   available that would help understand China's recent development in
   urbanization, its spatial features and links to water and energy
   security, particularly regarding residential consumption, and related
   national policy-making. Consequently, we address these knowledge gaps by
   performing an integrated and quantitative spatio-temporal analysis of
   the impacts of China's urbanization on water use and energy-related CO2
   emissions of residential consumption. We propose adding residential per
   capita water use and per capita energy-related CO2 emissions as national
   indicators for policy-making targets of China's water and energy
   security. Over the study period of 2003-2012, per capita rural
   residential water use was on the increase, while urban use showed the
   opposite trend. Rural consumption has been remarkably higher than the
   urban, and this gap appears to be growing. In contrast, the per capita
   energy-related CO2 emissions of residential consumption augmented
   significantly in both urban and rural areas nationwide. Besides, both
   the total and rural per capita residential water use and energy-related
   CO2 emissions showed a significant positive correlation. However, in
   urban areas this correlation was negative. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Hydropower is a valuable renewable energy resource in India, which can
   help in climate change mitigation and meet the increasing energy
   demands. However, the crucial role of climate change on hydropower
   production in India remains unexplored. Here using the observations and
   model simulations, we show that seven large hydropower projects
   experienced a significant (p-value < 0.05) warming and a decline in
   precipitation and streamflow during the observed period of 1951-2007.
   However, all the hydropower projects are projected to experience a
   warmer and wetter climate in the future. Multimodel ensemble mean annual
   average temperature (precipitation) is projected to rise up to 6.3 +/-
   1.6 degrees C (18 +/- 14.6\%) in the catchments upstream of the other
   reservoirs by the end of the 21st century under representative
   concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. Due to the projected increase in
   precipitation, mean annual streamflow (up to + 45\%) and hydropower (up
   to + 25\%) production are projected to rise under the future climate.
   However, significant warming (6.25 +/- 1.62 degrees C) is projected to
   result in a decline in streamflow and hydropower production in May-June
   for snow-dominated Nathpa Jhakri and Bhakra Nangal hydropower projects.
   Our results provide insights into the development and planning of
   hydropower projects in India under the current projected future climate.}},

Abstract = {{Excess heat on photovoltaic panels can limit their efficiency owning to
   an increase in internal resistance and consequent energy losses. This
   work aims to evaluate the effect of a water-cooling sprinkler system
   underneath polycrystalline photovoltaic modules. Voltage, current,
   power, and efficiency were monitored to quantify system performance.
   Three periods of analysis were defined. The first had intermittent
   cooling, the second had no cooling and the third had continuous cooling
   in the hottest hours of the day. The analysis occurred at two levels of
   irradiation - high and low. The use of the cooling system at a high
   level of irradiation resulted in a 12.26\% relative increase in power
   and a 12.17\% relative increase in efficiency. At a low irradiation
   level, the relative power and efficiency increased by 8.48\% and 9.09\%,
   respectively. The cooling system had a significant effect on the power
   and efficiency of the studied photovoltaic panel. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Exploring the surface energy exchange between atmosphere and water
   bodies is essential to gain a quantitative understanding of regional
   climate change, especially for the lakes in the desert. In this study,
   measurements of energy flux and water vapor were performed over a lake
   in the Badain Jaran Desert, China from March 2012 to March 2013. The
   studied lake had about a 2-month frozen period (December and January)
   and a 10-month open-water period (February-November). Latent heat flux
   (LE) and sensible heat flux (Hs) acquired using the eddy covariance
   technique were argued by measurements of longwave and shortwave
   radiation. Both fluxes of longwave and shortwave radiation showed
   seasonal dynamics and daily fluctuations during the study period. The
   reflected solar radiation was much higher in winter than in other
   seasons. LE exhibited diurnal and seasonal variations. On a daily scale,
   LE was low in the morning and peaked in the afternoon. From spring
   (April) to winter (January), the diurnal amplitude of LE decreased
   slowly. LE was the dominant heat flux throughout the year and consumed
   most of the energy from the lake. Generally speaking, LE was mostly
   affected by changes in the ambient wind speed, while Hs was primarily
   affected by the product of water-air temperature difference and wind
   speed. The diurnal LE and Hs were negatively correlated in the
   open-water period. The variations in Hs and LE over the lake were
   differed from those on the nearby land surface. The mean evaporation
   rate on the lake was about 4.0 mm/d over the entire year, and the
   cumulative annual evaporation rate was 1445 mm/a. The cumulative annual
   evaporation was 10 times larger than the cumulative annual
   precipitation. Furthermore, the average evaporation rates over the
   frozen period and open-water period were approximately 0.6 and 5.0 mm/d,
   respectively. These results can be used to analyze the water balance and
   quantify the source of lake water in the Badain Jaran Desert.}},

Abstract = {{Water and flow reductions in the channels downstream of water storage
   and hydropower projects have significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems.
   Understanding and analyzing the ecosystem status is of great
   significance to facilitate the protection of riverine ecosystems. A
   database was established based on the 2000-2017 environmental impact
   assessment (EIA) reports on water storage and hydropower projects in
   China, and corresponding analysis software was built based on an ArcGIS
   spatial analysis platform. The projects in China are mainly found in the
   Yangtze and Pearl River basins and in south-western China. The
   hydropower projects have a larger influence than the water storage
   projects on the flow of downstream rivers sections, and most of the
   hydropower projects, especially the water diversion projects, cause flow
   reductions in the downstream rivers. An ecological flow management
   mechanism in China implemented in 2006 provided a promising method to
   alleviate river flow reductions. However, there is still only one kind
   of ecological flow calculation method and few ecological flow regulation
   measures in use. Based on the advantages and problems of the existing
   ecological flow management system, this paper proposes a management
   scheme based on a regional-engineering calculation method. The results
   can facilitate decision making in ecological flow management.}},

Abstract = {{1. Small hydropower projects ( SHPs) are promoted as environmentally
   benign alternatives to larger dams; however, the impacts of SHPs have
   been poorly studied, especially in tropical developing countries, where
   their growth is being encouraged. 2. This study assessed the impacts of
   two SHPs on freshwater fish communities in the Western Ghats
   biodiversity hotspot of India. Two dammed and one undammed tributary of
   the Netravathi River, having similar stream order, elevation, and
   surrounding land- use types, were identified as test and control sites
   respectively. Streamgeometry, water chemistry, and fish assemblages were
   compared across upstream, dewatered,
   anddownstreamlocationcategorieswithin andacross the threestreams. 3.
   Flow alterations induced by SHPs affected the dewatered river stretches
   most severely. Stream wetted width and depths diminished drastically in
   dammed dewatered segments, and consequently this region was
   characterized by elevated water temperature and reduced dissolved
   oxygen. 4. Fish species composition varied significantly between dammed
   and undammed sites, across the upstream, dewatered, and downstream
   location categories. Dammed segments had lower fish species richness,
   diversity, and endemicity, and were dominated by eurytopic species (
   adapted to lentic conditions), unlike the control site, which was
   dominated by rheophilic species ( adapted to flowing waters). Regression
   analyses indicated that fish species richness in dammed streams
   increased with distance from the dam in the upstream direction. 5. The
   SHPs were found to have severe impacts on stream geometry, water
   chemistry, and aquatic biota, especially in the dry season. 6. Given the
   ambitious targets of planned SHP growth, most of which are within
   ecologically fragile regions, changes in SHP operations and policies are
   proposed to enable the conservation of river fish diversity. These
   include mandatory environmental impact assessments, conserving undammed
   headwater streams in regulated basins, maintaining adequate
   environmental flows, and implementing other mitigation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns about impacts of biomass growth for biofuel production
   emphasize the importance of planning energy crops expansion considering
   land, water, food and biodiversity. Brazil is the second largest ethanol
   producer worldwide and sugarcane is cultivated in many regions,
   including the Brazilian Cerrado (a Savannah-type biome). This paper
   analyses the impacts of first-generation sugarcane expansion in the
   Paranaiba basin (Goias State), focusing on how future demand for ethanol
   could affect local resources availability. The study area is a sugarcane
   expansion frontier in Brazil, thus, the Cerrado biome should be focus of
   research considering competition for land and water uses. An
   economic-ecologic Input-Output (IO) framework was applied to develop a
   water-energy-food (WEF) nexus analysis. The Goias' IO table was expanded
   to assess water, energy and land uses, GHG emissions and employment
   levels through six different ethanol supply scenarios.
   Results show that if sugarcane expansion projected to 2030 considers the
   Goias' extended IO structure for the year 2008, it should cause little
   impact on land and water availability in the state, due to both the
   ample availability of suitable pasturelands for sugarcane expansion as
   well as water in most of the Paranaiba basin. The WEF nexus analysis is
   a valuable tool on guiding the sustainable management of natural
   resources considering water, energy, land use and GHG emissions as goals
   to the same policy. In particular, the hybrid extended IO-WEF nexus
   framework is useful to design effective biofuel policies, collectively
   addressing impacts on environmental, social and economic spheres, in a
   local or broader context.}},

Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{41-58}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Energy use represents one of the main costs in water supply and
   wastewater treatment in China and is also a major contributor to
   greenhouse gas emissions. This paper has two aims. Firstly, it presents
   the first complete review of the growing body of literature on energy
   for water in urban China. Secondly, it identifies the most feasible
   suggestions for reducing and recovering energy in China's urban water
   systems based on the literature. The review finds wastewater is the area
   with most potential for net energy and emissions reduction. Anaerobic
   sludge digestion is commonly used in thousands of plants across the
   world, but it is applied in fewer than 3\% of Chinese wastewater
   treatment plants. Many Chinese plants are large enough to make anaerobic
   digestion feasible and could potentially offset around 50\% of their
   energy use by using the heat and power produced by burning biogas.
   Energy recovery can be increased through co-digestion and increasing
   primary sludge collection, or by using heat pumps to transfer energy in
   wastewater to nearby buildings. Land application of sludge can be used
   to significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions associated with wastewater
   sludge, almost all of which is currently landfilled or dumped without
   stabilisation in China. In water supply, minimising water leakage and
   increasing the efficiency of water pumping in high-rise buildings are
   practical ways to reduce net energy use for conventional water supply.
   In cases when water is scarce and cannot be transferred between
   provinces using gravity, wastewater reclamation combined with energy
   recovery is the least energy-intensive alternative water source and
   should be supported by strong government policy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a generalized inverse and mode assurance criterion
   based stochastic subspace identification (GMSSI) method to improve the

   to estimate the state subspace model of power system from synchrophasor

   estimate the model order and the state matrix of power system is
   obtained. To accurately separate the electromechanical modes from
   trivial modes, the generalized inverse of SSI is used to estimate
   another state matrix. Further, the mode filtering and mode assurance
   criterion (MAC) are developed to distinguish the electromechanical
   modes. Simulation data and field-measurement data from CSG are used to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed GMSSI method. The comparison
   between existing measurement-based mode estimation methods and the

Abstract = {{For the past three decades, the notion of sustainable cities has become
   central in planning and managing urban areas in the world and the
   large-scale city formation has been formed in big cities. As a result of
   economic growth and urban transformation, Shanghai, a major Chinese
   international metropolis, faces ongoing issues with resource waste and
   low energy utilization. Therefore, this paper aims to consider the
   availability of water for energy production from a consumption-based
   perspective and estimate the water footprint of the energy supply using
   a regional input-output analysis approach for Shanghai. As a result, we
   conclude that the water footprint of the energy supply of Shanghai is
   about 1.28 billion m(3) in 2007, with 46.1\% of water used for
   electricity and heat supply. The total water withdrawal by the energy
   sector is about 2.35 billion m(3) and additional water withdrawal needed
   is about 35\% of the total water withdrawals by the energy sector in
   Shanghai. Furthermore, an energy self-sufficiency scenario was
   developed, and the scenario analysis reveals that 55\% more water would
   be required to ensure a self-sufficient energy sector. To guarantee
   future regional energy security, it is important to manage water
   resources effectively by allocating water resources among sectors. (C)

   Balance under Different Climatic Conditions}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Vegetation serves as a key element in the land-atmospheric system, and
   changes in vegetation can impact the regional water-energy balance via
   several biophysical processes. This study proposes a new water-energy
   balance index that estimates the available-water-to-available-energy
   ratio (WER) by improving upon the Budyko framework, which evaluates
   climate variation and vegetation change. Moreover, the impact of
   vegetation greening on WER is quantified in 34 catchments under
   different climatic conditions. The results show that the normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) increased at all the catchments,
   which indicates that there was a vegetation greening trend in the study
   area. There are negative relationships between the NDVI and runoff at
   both water-limited and energy-limited catchments, which demonstrates
   that both types of catchments became drier due to vegetation greening.
   Four numerical experiments were executed to quantify the contribution of
   vegetation greening and climate variations to WER changes. The results
   show that the calculated WER trends by numerical tests fit well with the
   observed WER trends (R-2 = 0.96). Vegetation greening has positive
   influences on WER changes under energy-limited conditions, which
   indicates that residual energy decreases faster than water availability,
   resulting in less energy for sensible heat, i.e., a cooling effect.
   Nevertheless, vegetation greening has negative influences on WER under
   water-limited conditions, which indicates that water availability
   decreases faster than residual energy, resulting in more energy for
   sensible heat. Notably, the WER decrease in water-limited catchments is
   dominated by potential evapotranspiration and NDVI variation, whereas
   the WER change in energy-limited catchments is dominated by climate
   variation. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the
   relationships among water, energy and vegetation greening under
   different climatic conditions, which is important for
   land-atmosphere-vegetation modeling and designing strategies for
   ecological conservation and local water resource management.}},

   develop a geographic information system (GIS)-based framework to improve
   SHP planning in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, by providing site selection
   for development based on social-environmental restrictions. The
   framework used a GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis based on the
   analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to classify and weigh each attribute
   used. The results indicated that the number of planned SHPs is
   relatively high for Minas Gerais State (203), with the majority either
   in the Inventory or Project Assigned stages. The results also
   highlighted priority and nonpriority areas for SHPs by considering the
   likelihood of the SHPs causing the least and greatest socioenvironmental
   disturbances, respectively. The GIS-based framework has proved to be
   effective for improving SHP development in Minas Gerais State while
   suggesting site selection of priority areas that are likely to cause the
   least negative social-environmental impacts. (c) 2018 American Society

Abstract = {{Bioenergy from cassava is a promising alternative energy source for both
   energy supply and the mitigation of greenhouse gases. However, major
   global trends, such as climate change and competing landuse patterns,
   pose substantial risks to the sustainable development of bioenergy. The
   main purpose of this study was to assess the sustainable development of
   bioenergy from cassava, considering landuse change and climate change
   with a biogeochemical process model within the ``water-energy-food{''}
   nexus framework. The results showed that the land resources that were
   suitable for the development of cassava bioenergy have continuously
   decreased in China since 1990. At the same time, the climate has also
   undergone significant changes, with temperature showing an increasing
   trend, and precipitation showing a decreasing trend. With the influences
   of both landuse change and climate change, the total bioenergy of
   cassava showed a downward trend. In China, the potential bioenergy
   production for the year 1990, 2000, and 2010 was 6075 PJ, 5974 PJ, and
   4399 PJ, respectively. Compared to 1990, the bioenergy production in
   2010 decreased by 1676.40 million GJ, which equals 57 million tons of
   standard coal. In addition, the water footprint of bioenergy from
   cassava was discussed. After considering changes to landuse, climate,
   and water footprint, it was concluded that Guangxi was the most suitable
   place to develop cassava bioenergy, followed by Fujian, Guangdong, and
   Yunnan.}},

   States}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In the western United States, 27\% of electricity demand is met by
   hydropower, so power system planners have a key interest in predicting
   hydropower availability under changing climate conditions. Large-scale
   projections of hydropower generation are often simplified based on
   regression relationships with runoff and they are not always ready to
   inform power system models due to the coarse time scale (annual) or
   limited number of represented power plants. We developed an enhanced
   process-based hydropower model to predict future hydropower generation
   by addressing the commonly under-represented constraints, including (1)
   the ecological spills, (2) penstock constraints to provide flexibility
   in electricity operations, and (3) biases in hydro-meteorological
   simulations. We evaluated the model over the western United States under
   two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and ten downscaled global
   circulation models. At the annual time scale, potential hydropower
   generation is not projected to change substantially, except in
   California. At the seasonal time scale, systematic shifting of the
   generation patterns can be observed in snowmelt-dominated regions. These
   projected annual and regional trends are comparable to other
   regression-based relationships. However, the representation of more
   complex operations and constraints tend to reduce the uncertainties
   inherent to climate projections at seasonal scale. In the Pacific
   Northwest region where hydropower is the dominant electricity source,
   our predicted future change of hydropower generation is about 10\% less
   than the regression-based projections in spring and summer. The model
   can also capture the seasonal non-stationary in hydrologic changes. The
   spatio and temporal scales of the model, increased accuracy and
   quantification of uncertainty allow one to use the products to inform
   power system models toward supporting energy sector planning activities
   and water-energy trade-offs.}},

Abstract = {{Research on water cooperation in the Eastern Nile Basin has focused on
   expanding policy and diplomacy tools for a better allocation of

   cooperation on water and related sectors such as energy and land expands

   This basin represents an illustrative case for regional cooperation and
   increased integration due to multiple comparative advantages inherent in
   the uneven endowments of water, energy and arable land resources, and to
   varying levels of economic and technological advancement among the three

Abstract = {{Land surface water and energy fluxes from the ensemble mean of the

   precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff showed a global positive
   bias of 0.44, 0.27, and 0.15 mm day(-1), respectively. For the energy
   budget, while the AM2.5 net radiation agreed very well with the PGF/VIC,
   the AM2.5 improperly partitioned the net radiation, with the latent heat
   showing positive bias and sensible heat showing negative bias. The AM2.5
   net radiation, latent heat, and sensible heat relative to the PGF/VIC
   had a global negative bias of 1.42 W m(-2), positive bias of 7.8 W
   m(-2), and negative bias of 8.7 W m(-2), respectively. The three

   deficiencies in cloud parameterizations. At a regional scale, the biases
   of the AM2.5 water and energy budget components are mostly comparable to
   the three reanalyses and PGF/VIC. While the AM2.5 well simulated the

   correlations of the three reanalyses with PGF/VIC were mostly greater
   than the AM2.5, partly due to the ensemble mean of the AM2.5 members

Abstract = {{Electric mobility is expected to play a key role in the decarbonisation
   of the energy system. Continued development of battery electric vehicles
   is fundamental to achieving major reductions in the consumption of
   fossil fuels and of CO2 emissions in the transport sector. Hydrogen can
   become an important complementary synthetic fuel providing electric
   vehicles with longer ranges. However, the environmental benefit of
   electric vehicles is significant only if their additional electricity
   consumption is covered by power production from renewable energy
   sources. Analysing the implications of different scenarios of electric
   vehicles and renewable power generation considering their spatial and
   temporal characteristics, we investigate possible effects of electric
   mobility on the future power system in Germany and Europe. The time
   horizon of the scenario study is 2050. The approach is based on power
   system modelling that includes interchange of electricity between
   European regions, which allows assessing long-term structural effects in
   energy systems with over 80\% of renewable power generation. The study
   exhibits strong potential of controlled charging and flexible hydrogen
   production infrastructure to avoid peak demand increases and to reduce
   the curtailment of renewable power resulting in reduced system
   operation, generation, and network expansion costs. A charging strategy
   that is optimised from a systems perspective avoids in our scenarios 3.5

Abstract = {{Large-scale vegetation construction has generally led to soil
   desiccation in arid and semi-arid regions. Energy crops with high
   biomass and water use efficiency are generally beneficial to agriculture
   and the environment. It is necessary to understand how to maintain the

   energy croplands. In this study, soil moisture data at different depths
   of soil were obtained from long-term field observations for two energy
   crops, i.e., Panicum virgatum and Miscanthus sinensis, and a forage
   crop-Medicago saliva. Relative aridity of the soil and plant biomass
   were compared among different vegetation types, transects, and
   cultivation years. Medicago sativa soil was severely, even extremely,
   desiccative with increasing cultivation years, whereas there was nearly
   no desiccation in the soil of energy crops. The values of compared soil
   water storage compensation indexes in deep soil layers were higher than
   those in shallow soil layers, with the evaluated soil water storage
   compensation index being the smallest in the 40-80 cm layer. Energy
   crops had significantly higher aboveground biomass, mostly exhibiting
   more than 2.6 kg m(-2), while the aboveground biomass of M. saliva was
   only above 0.5 kg m(-2). Furthermore, the water use efficiencies of
   energy crops were obviously higher than that of M. saliva (P < 0.05).
   Our results indicated that deep soil moisture conditions were mainly
   determined by field crop types. Energy crops may be suitable candidates
   for compensating soil water storage and maintaining high biomass
   production in semi-arid regions.}},

Abstract = {{Over the years, sustainability and impact on the environment, as well as
   operation expenditure, have been major concerns in the deployment of
   mobile cellular base stations (BSs) worldwide. This is because mobile
   cellular BSs are known to consume a high percentage of power within the
   mobile cellular network. Such energy consumption contributes to the
   emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) through the use of conventional
   diesel generating set (gen-set). As a result, mobile cellular operators
   are faced with the dilemma of minimizing the power consumption, GHG
   emissions, and operation cost, while improving the quality of service
   (QoS) of the networks. In attempting to find a solution, this study
   presents the feasibility and simulation of a solar photovoltaic
   (PV)/battery hybrid power system (HPS), as a predominant source of power
   for a specific mobile cellular BS site situated in the Soshanguve area
   of the city of Pretoria, South Africa. It also presents the technical
   development and shows the environmental advantage and cost benefits of
   using a solar PV/battery HPS to power a BS site with a 24 h daily load
   of 241.10 kWh/d and peak load of 20.31 kW as compared to using the HPS
   with a solar PV/diesel gen-set/battery. The solar resource pattern for
   the city of Pretoria was collected from the National Aeronautics and
   Space Administration and was modeled statistically. The statistical
   modeling done using solar radiation resource exposure characteristic
   patterns of Pretoria, South Africa revealed an average annual daily
   solar radiation of 5.4645 Wh/m(2)/d and a 0.605 clearness index. The
   simulation and the design were done using Hybrid Optimization Model for
   Electric Renewables (HOMER) and Matlab/Simulink software. The simulation
   finding showed that the HPS of the solar PV/battery combination has
   about a 59.62\% saving in the net present cost (NPC) and levelized cost
   of energy (LCOE) and an 80.87\% saving in operating cost as against
   conventional BSs powered with a gen-set/battery.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{190}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Water reservoirs are used for many purposes, such as water supply,
   irrigation, flood mitigation, and hydroelectric energy generation.
   Although hydroelectric energy is considered ``green,{''} many studies
   show that the construction of a reservoir enhances greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions at the transformed area. These emissions, mainly of CO2, CH4,
   and N2O gases, depend on the age of the reservoir, landscape and soil
   composition, fauna and flora remnants of the impounded area, climatic
   conditions, and basin runoffs. Consequently, GHG emissions significantly
   vary between reservoirs and depending on local specificities. Several
   studies have investigated GHG emissions from reservoirs around the
   world, focusing mainly on reservoirs located in cold regions, temperate
   regions, and tropical regions. Research is lacking for reservoirs in
   Mediterranean countries, like Greece, and similar regions. This work
   initially assesses the net GHG emissions of a newly created reservoir
   (Ilarion est. 2012) in Western Macedonia, Greece. The methodology for
   net GHG emission calculation was based on the use of literature data
   concerning pre-impoundment emission factors and local specificities of
   the reservoir (terrain type, canopy cover), as well as on the 2-year
   measurement data that were collected using a ``static floating
   chamber.{''} Furthermore, in this work, the gross GHG emissions of an
   older, in-line reservoir (Polyfytos est. 1974) were also calculated,
   based on 2-year measurement data. The results show that the global
   warming potential (GWP) of the reservoirs is dictated by methane
   emissions; it minimizes during winter and spring and maximizes during
   summer and autumn. Hydroelectric energy production at Ilarion Reservoir
   results in 32 to 97 times less total CO2 equivalent emissions in
   comparison to fossil fuels, while at Polyfytos Reservoir only 8 to 24
   times less (based on gross emissions). It appears that the impact of a
   reservoir's morphology on GHG emissions is more significant than that of
   a reservoir's age.}},

Abstract = {{China has the richest hydropower resources in the world. Yunnan's
   exploitable hydropower resources rank third in China, second only to
   Tibet and Sichuan Province. Yunnan has experienced soaring growth in
   installed hydropower capacity in the past several decades. The fast
   development of hydropower makes the province one of the main producers
   and exporters of hydroelectricity. However, with inconsistencies between
   hydropower development and various related resources, more and more
   hydropower generation has been curtailed in recent years. The increasing
   curtailment of hydropower generation not only caused large-scale waste
   of sustainable energy, but also impaired the potential higher
   contribution of hydropower for GHG emission reduction. This paper
   provides an overview of the hydropower resources and their development
   in Yunnan and systematically analyzes the constraints causing the
   curtailment of hydropower generation. We argue that there are several
   constraining factors such as slowdown of economic growth, inadequate
   transmission capacity due to a weak grid structure, inconsistency
   between power grid companies and local government, and uneven
   distribution of precipitation seasonally and annually. Recommendations
   are made to alleviate or eliminate hydropower curtailment in Yunnan and

Abstract = {{Across the world, human activity is approaching planetary boundaries. In
   northwest China, in particular, the coal industry and agriculture are
   competing for key limited inputs of land and water. In this situation,
   the traditional approach to planning the development of each sector
   independently fails to deliver sustainable solutions, as solutions made
   in sectorial silos' are often suboptimal for the entire economy. We
   propose a spatially detailed cost-minimizing model for coal and
   agricultural production in a region under constraints on land and water
   availability. We apply the model to the case study of Shanxi province,
   China. We show how such an integrated optimization, which takes maximum
   advantage of the spatial heterogeneity in resource abundance, could help
   resolve the conflicts around the water-food-energy (WFE) nexus and
   assist in its management. We quantify the production-possibility
   frontiers under different water-availability scenarios and demonstrate
   that in water-scarce regions, like Shanxi, the production capacity and
   corresponding production solutions are highly sensitive to water
   constraints. The shadow prices estimated in the model could be the basis
   for intelligent differentiated water pricing, not only to enable the
   water-resource transfer between agriculture and the coal industry, and
   across regions, but also to achieve cost-effective WFE management.}},

Title = {{Carbon Footprint Assessment of Four Normal Size Hydropower Stations in
   China}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The emission of Greenhouse gases (GHG) during the life cycle of four
   hydropower stations with installed capacity from 95 MW to 500 MW are
   assessed by the integrated GHG reservoir tool developed by International
   Hydropower Association. Model inputs are extracted from multi-source
   geographic datasets and construction planning documents. Three main
   conclusions are summarized: (1) In pre- and post-impoundment stages,
   areal GHG emission balance in reservoir area depends on the climate
   background, humid subtropical regions are more active than arid
   temperate regions. In the construction stage, emissions from fill,
   concrete and equipment account for more than 70\% of the total. (2) GHG
   intensity falls rapidly when lifetime increases from 10 to 40 years and
   then drops slightly when lifetime becomes longer, which is 13.60
   tCO(2)e/GWh for 50 years and 8.13 tCO(2)e/GWh for 100 years on average.
   The emission rates of hydropower stations with lower installed capacity
   are obviously large if they work for less than 30 years and differ less
   with stations possessing a higher installed capacity when their lifetime
   approaches 100 years. (3) Comparing with electricity generated by coal
   in China whose GHG intensity is 822 tCO(2)e/GWh, hydroelectricity is
   almost 100 times more efficient and clean. Thus, hydropower station
   plays an important role in dealing with the global warming issue as a
   substitution for a fossil fuel power source.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of renewable energy
   alternatives to Inga 3, a 4.8-GW hydropower project on the Congo River,
   to serve the energy needs of the host country, the Democratic Republic
   of Congo (DRC), and the main buyer, South Africa. To account for a key
   uncertainty in the literature regarding the additional economic impacts
   of managing variable wind and solar electricity, we built a spatially
   and temporally detailed power system investment model for South Africa.
   We find that a mix of wind, solar photovoltaics, and some natural gas is
   more cost-effective than Inga 3 to meet future demand except in
   scenarios with pessimistic assumptions about wind technology
   performance. If a low load growth forecast is used, including Inga 3 in
   the power mix results in higher system cost across all sensitivities. In
   our scenarios, the effect of Inga 3 deployment on South African power
   system cost ranges from an increase of ZAR 4300 (US\$ 330) million
   annually to savings of ZAR 1600 (US\$ 120) million annually by 2035. A
   cost overrun as low as 20\% makes the Inga 3 scenarios more expensive in
   all sensitivity cases. Including time and cost overruns and losses in
   transmission from DRC to South Africa make Inga 3 an even less
   attractive investment. For DRC, through analysis of spatial datasets
   representing technical, physical, and environmental constraints, we find
   abundant renewable energy potential: 60 GWof solar photovoltaic and
   0.6-2.3 GWof wind located close to transmission infrastructure have
   levelized costs less than US\$ 0.07 per kWh, or the anticipated cost of
   Inga 3 to residential consumers.}},

Volume = {{116}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Anthropogenic activities along streams and rivers may be of major
   concern for fluvial ecosystems, e.g. abstraction and impoundment of
   surface water resources may profoundly alter natural streamflow regimes.
   An established approach aimed at preserving the behavior and
   distribution of fluvial species relies on the definition of ecological
   flows (e-flows) downstream of dams and diversion structures. E-flow
   prescriptions are usually set by basin authorities at regional scale,
   often without a proper assessment of their impact and effectiveness. On
   the contrary, we argue that e-flows should be identified on the basis of
   (i) regional and (H) quantitative assessments. We focus on central Italy
   and evaluate the effects on habitat suitability of two near-threatened
   fish species (i.e. Barbel and Chub) and an existing hydro-power network
   when shifting from the current time-invariant e-flow policy to a tighter
   and seasonally-varying soon-to-be-enforced one. Our example clearly
   shows that (a) quantitative regional scale assessments are viable even
   when streamflow observations are entirely missing at study sites; (b)
   aprioristic e-flows policies may impose releases that exceed natural
   streamflows for significantly long time intervals (weeks, or months);
   (c) unduly tightening e-flow policies may heavily impact regional
   hydro-power productivity (15\% and 42\% losses on annual and seasonal
   basis, respectively), yet resulting in either marginal or negligible
   improvements of fluvial ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Electric power system (EPS) management considering greenhouse gas (GHG)

   expressed as not only fuzzy possibilistic distributions associated with
   the right-hand-side components of model constraints but also discrete
   intervals in the objective function. In addition, ICCP allowed
   satisfaction of system constraints at specified confidence level,
   leading to model solutions with low system cost under acceptable risk
   magnitudes. The obtained results indicated that stable intervals for the
   objective function and decision variables could be generated, which were
   useful for helping decision makers identify the desired electric power

Abstract = {{India's increasing growth in GDP, which rose from 3.7\% annually in
   1961-7.9\% annually in 2015, has resulted in a rising demand for energy
   that almost doubled between 2000 and 2015. This trend is expected to
   continue due to urbanization, industrialization, and expansion of
   domestic manufacturing, encouraged by the Make in India initiative. A
   framework that considers a long-term road map for energy security is
   necessary to transform India from a country of chronic power shortages
   to one with reliable sources of energy. Elements of this framework
   include a sustainable energy mix, stronger reliance on green energy
   sources like hydro, solar and wind power, less dependency on coal, and
   strengthened cooperation on energy trade with neighbouring countries in
   South Asia. This paper discusses the long-term transboundary energy
   collaboration between India and Bhutan and the benefits for India in
   terms of diversification of energy sources and overall energy security.
   By assessing reciprocal benefits for India, we attempt to substantiate
   our claim that the India-Bhutan energy collaboration is strongly based
   on the principle of mutual benefits that extend to overall security.
   Cooperation between India and Bhutan is unique rather than a model in

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in the global water-energy-food (WEF)
   system and potential system trajectories, especially considering growing
   concerns over resource exploitation and sustainability. Previous studies
   investigating different aspects of this system have a number of
   shortcomings, meaning it is difficult to identify system-wide tradeoffs,
   and makes comparison difficult. A global analysis of the WEF system
   linked to gross domestic product (GDP) growth is presented, integrating
   the four sectors into a coherent analysis and modelling framework. GDP
   was included as previous related work demonstrates a link between GDP
   and each WEF sector. A system dynamics modelling approach quantifies
   previously qualitative descriptions of the global WEF-GDP system, while
   a Monte-Carlo sampling approach is adopted to characterise
   national-level variability in resource use. Correlative and causal
   analysis show links of varying strength between sectors. For example,
   the GDP electricity consumption sectors are strongly correlated while
   food production and electricity consumption are weakly correlated.
   Causal analysis reveals that `correlation does not imply causation'.
   There are noticeable asymmetries in causality between certain sectors.
   Historical WEF-GDP values are well recreated. Future scenarios were
   assessed using seven GDP growth estimates to 2100. Water withdrawals in
   2100 and food production in 2050 are close to other estimations. Results
   suggest that humanity risks exceeding the `safe operating space' for
   water withdrawal. Reducing water withdrawal while maintaining or
   increasing food production is critical, and should be decoupled from
   economic growth. This work provides a quantitative modelling framework
   to previously qualitative descriptions of the WEF-GDP system, offering a
   platform on which to build.}},

Abstract = {{The Yangtze River is one of the largest and most important rivers in the
   world. Over the past several decades, the flow regime of the Yangtze
   River has been altered by human activities, particularly dam
   construction. Hydrological regimes will be further influenced due to
   more dams that have been planned and are being built in the upper reach
   of the Yangtze River (URYR). In this context, to assess the impacts of
   cascade dam development on the natural flows, four different scenarios
   of the reservoirs' combination are simulated with a hydrological model
   (the Soil and Water Assessment Tool) in the URYR. Flow regime changes
   were investigated using the eco-flow metrics and minimum/optimal
   ecological flow with the simulated daily river flows. The results
   indicate that eco-surplus in low flows and eco-deficit in high flows
   greatly increases due to reservoir operations when more reservoirs are
   put into service. The minimum ecological flow and the optimal ecological
   flow cannot be guaranteed from September to November, which is a crucial
   time for fish spawning. To maintain the natural regime while meeting the
   requirements for the river ecosystem, we propose that the lower and
   satisfactory operation limits are 11,680 m(3)/s and 7235 m(3)/s and
   16,300 m(3)/s and 9130 m(3)/s, respectively. Optimizing cascade

Abstract = {{The Ili River originates in the mountains of Xinjiang, China, and flows

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Shale deposits are globally abundant and widespread. Extraction of shale
   oil and shale gas is generally performed through water-intensive
   hydraulic fracturing. Despite recent work on its environmental impacts,
   it remains unclear where and to what extent shale resource extraction
   could compete with other water needs. Here we consider the global
   distribution of known shale deposits suitable for oil and gas extraction
   and develop a water balance model to quantify their impacts on local
   water availability for other human uses and ecosystem functions. We find
   that 31-44\% of the world's shale deposits are located in areas where
   water stress would either emerge or be exacerbated as a result of shale
   oil or gas extraction; 20\% of shale deposits are in areas affected by
   groundwater depletion and 30\% in irrigated land. In these regions shale
   oil and shale gas production would likely compete for local water
   resources with agriculture, environmental flows, and other water needs.
   By adopting a hydrologic perspective that considers water availability
   and demand together, decision makers and local communities can better
   understand the water and food security implications of shale resource
   development.
   Plain Language Summary We present a global analysis of the impact of
   shale oil and gas extraction on water resources, particularly on
   irrigated crop production. Using a water balance analysis, we find that
   large areas underlain by shale deposits are either already affected by
   water stress or would become water stressed in the event that local
   water resources were to be used for shale oil or gas extraction. In
   these areas, the extraction of shale oil and shale gas is expected to
   compete with irrigated food production and other human water demands.
   The development of unconventional oil and gas from shale in water
   stressed areas of the world would need to overcome water scarcity
   challenges and would likely enhance competition for water in
   agriculturally important areas.}},

   is a conceptual framework that presents opportunities for greater
   resource coordination, management, and policy convergence across
   sectors. This is particularly relevant in the SADC region as resources
   are transboundary and supports efforts linked to regional integration
   and inclusive socio-economic development and security. We conducted an
   appraisal of WEF-related policies and institutions in SADC and
   identified linkages among them. The present silo' approach in resource
   management and allocation, often conducted at the national level,
   contributes to the region's failure to meet its development targets,
   exacerbating its vulnerabilities. The lack of coordination of WEF nexus
   synergies and trade-offs in planning often threatens the sustainability
   of development initiatives. We highlighted the importance of the WEF
   nexus to sustainably address the sectoral coordination of resources
   through harmonised institutions and policies, as well as setting targets
   and indicators to direct and monitor nexus developments. We illustrate
   the significance of the nexus in promoting inclusive development and
   transforming vulnerable communities into resilient societies. The study
   recommends a set of integrated assessment models to monitor and evaluate
   the implementation of WEF nexus targets. Going forward, we propose the
   adoption of a regional WEF nexus framework.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fundamental study of voltage collapses that occur
   on a post-fault trajectory of a stressed power system in seconds after
   large disturbances. The focus of the study are voltage collapses that
   are induced by certain load models. Using an n-machine-N-bus power
   system model, the paper explicitly shows that the voltage collapse is
   caused by the non-existence of a real, positive solution for a load
   voltage magnitude in different areas of a relative rotor angle space
   when the load is of non-linear type. These ``areas without voltage
   solution{''} are denoted as Voltage Impasse Regions (VIR) and are
   mathematically characterized as trigonometric functions of (n-1)
   relative rotor angles. Once the post-fault trajectory enters a VIR,
   voltage magnitude solutions become complex or negative, the algebraic
   Jacobian becomes singular, and the behaviour of a system becomes
   undefined. The case study has been carried out using a simple
   3-machine-1-load system with static load models. In the study, VIR
   appeared and enlarged as the non-linear (constant power and constant
   current) load increased. Furthermore, the non-convergence of time-domain
   solution occurred exactly at VIR, thereby confirming that the problem is
   of structural nature.}},

Abstract = {{Global warming is a worldwide problem that requires an international
   strategy to ensure compatibility of economic growth and overcoming
   climate change. Although global use of low-carbon technology is a
   solution, consideration of economic consequences is important to promote
   future technology development and use. Photovoltaic (PV) solar power
   system is a promising renewable technology that carries climate
   mitigation expectations. We conducted a value chain analysis to evaluate
   the economic effect of the manufacture and use of silicon PV solar power
   system worldwide. We quantitatively reviewed the flow of manufacturing
   and installation for cells, modules, and facilities (e.g., inverters)
   related to Japan, and estimated the retrospectively induced economic
   costs for Japan and other developed and developing countries. Material,
   equipment, labor, utility, transportation, and business operation costs
   were studied in detail at different manufacturing and installation
   stages. This unique evaluation methodology quantified economic costs
   from an international perspective. The retrospectively induced economic
   effect of 2014 PV solar power system sales in Japan (induced by cell
   module and system production by Japanese. companies and increased
   domestic use) was 1.6 trillion Japanese yen worldwide, of which 63\% was
   attributable to Japan, 10\% to other developed countries, and 27\% to
   developing countries. The economic effect in Japan in terms of equipment
   cost and installation stage was 37\% and 71\% of the total effect, which
   was particularly high. Further technical improvement, cost reduction,
   and improvement in inverter and manufacturing equipment reliability are
   important to capitalize Japan's strengths. Currently, Japan's
   involvement in the manufacturing of cells and modules is small.
   Therefore, both technical innovation and cost reduction are necessary.

Abstract = {{As more new energy power is integrated into the power grid in a large

   set is established including new energy resource risk, technical risk,
   demand side risk, grid side risk and human factor, and Crombach alpha
   reliability analysis is introduced to verify the rationality of this
   set. Then, D numbers theory is employed to integrate the expert

   based on DEMATEL method, the cause-effect relations and significance

Abstract = {{In recent years, the construction of China's power grid has experienced

Abstract = {{Determination of the focal mechanism of microseismic (MS) events
   occurring in rock engineering plays an important role in hazard
   evaluation and forecasting. A complete moment tensor inversion strategy
   is proposed to analyse MS events recorded at the left bank slope of the
   Baihetan hydropower station, southwest of China. A coordinate system
   rotation procedure is adopted to construct a reliable 1-D velocity model
   for the Green's function calculation. The layered velocities are
   accurately determined by inversion using the recorded blasts and
   geological survey results. To reduce the influence of noise
   contamination, only the waveforms in the frequency range of 60-150 Hz
   are analysed. Before moment tensor inversion, a relocation procedure
   using an eikonal solver is performed to accurately locate seismic
   sources. A robust global optimization routine is applied to maximize the
   objective function, thereby determining the focal mechanism. The
   proposed method is tested using a hypothetical seismic source in the
   sensor network used for monitoring MS events in the rock slope. The
   synthetic test shows that the method is robust and can provide accurate
   solutions when subject to location error, noise contamination and
   velocity model disturbances. The analysis results of the 12 MS events
   show that the moment tensors characterizing MS events present
   significant non-double-couple components and that the majority of the MS
   events have a strike orientation in accordance with that of the main

Abstract = {{As bio-ethanol is developing rapidly, its impacts on food security,

   result revealed that the energy consumption for pollutant removal was
   1.2 million tons coal equivalent (Mtce) for the 118 investigated plants

   removal was 13\% of total water consumption for electricity generation.
   The result implied that this policy could reduce SO2, NOx, and dust

   average of 2\% less energy and 8\% more water as tradeoffs. Construction
   cost associated with implementing these technology changes could be as

Abstract = {{Domestic water heating in Brazil is commonly done by electric
   showerheads, characterized by a large installed capacity and a low load
   factor. In that regard, consumers and utility companies present opposite
   interests, the first aim to reduce their electricity bill, while
   companies are interested on shaving on-peak consumption. Solar
   technologies offer significant potential for domestic applications, but
   the implementation is commonly hindered by economic issues. The present
   work shows a methodology for addressing the impact of promotion policies
   in terms of the benefits for consumers and utility companies. It is
   proposed a weighting procedure that allows to examine both interests in
   a single objective function. It enables determining a trade-off curve
   and optimizing the design parameters of the solar system (collector
   area, storage volume and set point temperature). Two policy scenarios
   were analyzed: a rebate program and the implementation of a time-of-use
   tariff (TOU) scheme. The results derived from the first policy scenario
   show the existence of a trade-off curve between the initial investment
   and the yearly electricity consumption, which is useful for addressing
   the impact of the monetary incentive considered for rebating the initial
   cost of the solar system. The second policy scenario shows a trade-off
   curve between the annualized life cycle cost of the system and the
   yearly on-peak electricity consumption. That curve can be used for
   assessing the influence of the TOU tariff on the on-peak electricity
   utilization, allowing to measure the impacts of the tariff scheme, and
   providing the basic parameters for negotiation strategies between

Abstract = {{Large-scale electricity policies that embrace renewable resources have
   led to continued investments in hydropower. Despite evolving viewpoints
   regarding the sustainability of large hydropower installations, there
   has been a major increase in support for the widespread development of
   small hydropower plants (SHPs). A global synthesis reveals that 82,891
   SHPs are operating or are under construction (11 SHPs for every one
   large hydropower plant) and that this number is estimated to triple if
   all potential generation capacity were to be developed. Fueled by
   considerable political and economic incentives in recent decades, the
   growth of SHPs has greatly outpaced available ecological science. We
   provide evidence for not only the lack of scientifically informed
   oversight of SHP development but also the limitations of the
   capacity-based regulations currently in use. The potential
   indiscriminate expansion of SHPs under the pretense of promoting
   sustainable energy is concerning, and we identify several important
   steps to help ensure new scientific advances, effective management, and
   policy reform in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Data on urban water resources are scarce, despite a majority of the U.S.
   population residing in urban environments. Further, information on the
   energy required to facilitate the treatment, distribution, and
   collection of urban water are even more limited. In this study, we
   evaluate the energy-for-water component of the energy-water nexus by
   providing and analyzing a unique primary database consisting of drinking
   water and wastewater utility flows and energy. These anthropogenic
   fluxes of water through the urban environment are used to assess the
   state of the U.S. urban energy-water nexus at over 160 utilities. The
   average daily per person water flux is estimated at 560 L of drinking
   water and 500 L of wastewater. Drinking water and wastewater utilities
   require 340 kWh/1,000 m(3) and 430 kWh/1,000 m(3) of energy,
   respectively, to treat these resources. The total national energy demand
   for water utilities accounts for 1.0\% of the total annual electricity
   consumption of the United States. Additionally, the water and embedded
   energy loss associated with non-revenue water accounts for 9.1 x 10(9)
   m(3) of water and 3,100 GWh, enough electricity to power 300,000 U.S.
   households annually. Finally, the water flux and embedded energy
   fluctuated monthly in many cities. As the nation's water resources
   become increasingly scarce and unpredictable, it is essential to have a
   set of empirical data for continuous evaluation and updates on the state
   of the U.S. urban energy-water nexus.}},

Abstract = {{Small hydropower (SHP) has a global reputation as a `green', low-carbon
   energy source that improves rural livelihoods and contributes to local
   economic development. In China, SHP has grown rapidly since the early
   2000s, particularly in the water-rich provinces in the country's
   southwest. However, because SHP plants in China are privately-operated
   and approved by local governments, there is an incentive to construct
   large, multiple cascade systems to generate as much power as possible.
   In many areas, this has led to over-development of SHP and associated
   negative environmental and social impacts. In this paper, we identify
   the factors that shape geographies of SHP over-development, what we
   refer to as `shades' of green energy. We then analyze the direct and
   indirect impacts of over-development. We draw on interviews and
   electricity generation data from six prefectures in Yunnan province, one
   of the world's largest hydropower producing regions. We find that
   prefectures that operate in a semi-autonomous way in electricity
   management and industrial planning are most prone to over-develop SHP,
   since they depend on hydropower revenues from electricity generation and
   local energy-intensive industries. We also find that over-development of
   SHP causes streamflow reductions and unstable electricity generation,
   and in some areas, drives an increase in environmentally-destructive
   mineral processing and reduces irrigation water access. These findings
   suggest a need for coordinated river basin planning on small watersheds
   and a reassessment of the role of SHP in local economic development.}},

Abstract = {{Hydropower generation plays a key role in mitigating GHG emissions from
   the overall power supply. Although the maximum achievable hydropower
   generation (MAHG) will be affected by climate change, it is seldom
   incorporated in integrated assessment models. In this study, we first
   used the H08 global hydrological model to project MAHG under two
   physical climate change scenarios. Then, we used the Asia-Pacific
   Integrated Model/Computable General Equilibrium integrated assessment
   model to quantify the economic consequences of the presence or absence
   of mitigation policy on hydropower generation. This approach enabled us
   to quantify the physical impacts of climate change and the effect of
   mitigation policy-together and in isolation-on hydropower generation and
   the economy, both globally and regionally. Although there was little
   overall global change, we observed substantial differences among regions
   in the MAHG average change (from - 71\% in Middle East to 14\% in Former
   Soviet Union in RCP8.5). We found that the magnitude of changes in
   regional gross domestic product (GDP) was small negative (positive) in
   Brazil (Canada) by 2100, for the no mitigation policy scenario. These
   consequences were intensified with the implementation of mitigation
   policies that enhanced the price competitiveness of hydropower against
   fossil fuel-powered technologies. Overall, our results suggested that
   there would be no notable globally aggregated impacts on GDP by 2100
   because the positive effects in some regions were canceled out by
   negative effects in other regions.}},

Abstract = {{Water and energy are intricately connected in households. The
   connections mainly appear in three types of residential behavior:
   bathing, cooking, and cleaning. This study investigated the features of
   water and related energy consumption in groups with different individual
   attributes and identified the key groups and types of behavior that
   correlate with water and energy conservation. A face-to-face interview
   method was applied to estimate residential water and energy consumption
   associated with three types of behavior. Regression analysis was applied
   to the results of 1017 questionnaires to explore the relationships
   between individual attributes and the amount of water used and
   associated energy consumption. Chi-square test and extended
   Mantel-Haenszel test were applied to confirm the relations between
   individual attributes and behavior. Annual per capita water use for the
   three types of behavior was 33.6 m(3) on average and annual per capita
   water related electricity consumption was estimated to be 545.7 kWh. The
   Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.8 with a confidence level of 99\%,
   which indicated a strong correlation between water use and energy
   consumption. The results showed that 55\% of household electricity
   consumption was coupled with water use in Beijing. Water use and related
   electricity consumption had a positive correlation with education but a
   negative correlation with age and family size. Young women under 30
   years old with a bachelor degree or above who live alone often use the
   most water and electricity, 16\% and 28\% higher than the average. This

Abstract = {{Reflected wave identification is the core of single-ended travelling
   wave fault location, in which the obvious superimposed oscillation is
   the main obstacle for precise reflected wave identification with field
   data. This study proposes a reflected wave identification method based
   on speeded-up robust features, which can gradually approximate from the
   possibly largest fault distance to the near-end fault distance so as to
   exclude the reflected wave from time window containing initial wave. In
   particular, the time window segmentation divides initial wave and
   reflected wave into two inconsistent time windows, hence the reflected
   wave from the superimposed oscillation that usually follows the
   travelling wave can be effectively separated, such that the
   identification of reflected wave can be significantly simplified.
   Lastly, the superimposed oscillation is thoroughly analysed while both
   the field data with and without obvious superimposed oscillation are
   presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Field
   data obtained from 21 substations scattered among Yunnan power grid of
   China validate the implementation feasibility of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{China's Eleventh Five-Year Plan and Twelfth Five-Year Plan explicitly
   proposed the strict control of the total amount and intensity of energy
   and water consumption. However, the synergy between energy and water
   resources conservation has rarely been taken into consideration, thereby
   making it difficult to maximize conservation. This study selects three
   major energy sectors for the assessment and optimization of the synergy
   between energy and water conservation. The results of the critical paths
   show that during the energy generation process, the chemical industry,
   the smelting and pressing of metals, and the mining and processing of
   nonmetal ores are coupling sectors, which use a combination of large
   amounts of energy and water resources. The implementation of energy-and
   water-saving actions in these sectors would effectively promote the
   synergistic energy-and water-conservation effects. The multi-objective
   optimization results suggest that the increased intensity of structural
   adjustment effectively enhanced synergy. Under the premise of a stable
   economy, the synergy could be improved by optimizing the output
   structure of each sector, especially coupling sectors in the flow paths
   of energy and water resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To keep the electric power system reliable, grid operators procure
   reserve generation capacity to protect against generator failures and
   significant deviation from the load forecast. Current methods for
   determining reserve requirements use historical generator availability
   data (recorded as failure events) to compute the fraction of the time
   each unit in the power system was unavailable unexpectedly. These values
   are then combined using analytical or simulation methods to yield a
   distribution of available capacity. From this distribution, the reserve
   capacity needed to maintain a particular reliability target may be
   determined. Such an approach implicitly assumes that generator failures
   occur independently of one another and that generator availability is
   not seasonal.
   To test these assumptions, we process the more than two million event
   records reported to the Generating Availability Data System (GADS)
   database maintained by the North American Electric Reliability
   Corporation (NERC) between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015. This
   allows us to construct complete availability histories (hourly time
   series) for each of the approximately 8000 generating units reporting to
   GADS during this period. Using these time series, we find strong
   evidence of correlated failures in most regions, even when removing
   Hurricane Sandy and the exceptionally cold month of January 2014 from
   the data. We find that correlated failures occur in all seasons. We do
   not find evidence of seasonality but note that seasonal structure may
   emerge with more data.
   In addition we determine the distribution of unscheduled unavailable
   capacity, unscheduled derating magnitudes, event durations, event
   arrival probabilities, and mean time between failure (MTBF) and mean
   time to recovery (MTTR) values. In each case, we report fit parameters
   to facilitate use by practitioners. The distributions of unscheduled
   unavailable capacity in each region are reasonably well modeled by
   Weibull and lognormal distributions. We find statistically significant
   differences in mean time between failure for small and large units for
   three unit types when aggregating over regions. Finally we present time
   series of unavailable capacity from unscheduled, maintenance, and
   scheduled events. These may be used in conjunction with load data to
   directly study resource adequacy risks without assuming independent
   failures or constant availability. Our findings suggest that power
   system resource planners should consider correlated outages as they
   identify reliability and reserve capacity requirements.}},

   In this study, a water footprint model for energy sources was developed,
   and water footprint inventories of the primary fossil fuels (e.g., coal,
   crude oil, natural gas) and power sources (e.g., thermal, nuclear, wind,
   solar photovoltaic, and hydropower) in China were compiled. The water
   footprints calculated for coal, crude oil, and natural gas were 0.14
   m(3)/GJ, 0.29 m(3)/GJ, and 0.11 m(3)/GJ, respectively. The water
   footprints of power sources increased as follows: wind (0.14 m(3)/GJ),

Abstract = {{The Colorado River is an important natural resource for the Southwestern
   United States. Predicted climate change impacts include increased
   temperature, decreased rainfall and increased probability of drought in
   this region. Given the large amount of hydropower on the Colorado River
   and its importance to the bulk electricity system, this purpose of this
   study was to quantify the value hydropower in operating the electrical
   system, and examined changes in hydropower value and electricity costs
   under different possible future drought conditions and regional
   generation scenarios. The goal was to better understand how these
   scenarios affect operating costs of the bulk electrical system, as well
   as the value of the hydropower produced, and proposed a method for doing
   so. The calculated value of the hydroelectric power was nearly double
   the mean locational marginal price in the study area, about \$73 to \$75
   for most scenarios, demonstrating a high value of the hydropower. In
   general, it was found that reduced water availability increased
   operating costs, and increased the value of the hydropower. A calculated
   value factor showed that when less hydroelectric power is available, the
   hydropower is more valuable. Furthermore, the value factor showed that
   the value of hydro increases with the addition of solar or the
   retirement of thermal generating resources.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the impact of future climate changes on long-term
   hydropower generation (LTHG) of cascade hydropower stations in the lower

   were used to estimate the impacts of future climate changes, the

   adopted to solve the LTHG problem. In case studies, the validation of
   the XAJ model shows that it perform well in the projection of streamflow
   in the Jinsha River. Moreover, the future hydropower generation is
   simulated based on five different GCMs under three climate change
   scenarios. Finally, the GSA algorithm is used to obtain a set of schemes
   under the influence of climate change. The results show that future
   climate changes are expected to have different impact on power
   generation of cascade reservoirs in the downstream of the Jinsha River

Abstract = {{This study develops a risk-aversion optimization model for an urban
   electric power system (RAOMUEPS), taking into account stochastic
   uncertainties. The RAOM-UEPS can manage stochastic uncertainties and
   capture associated risks from the stochastic information. This enables
   managers to analyze the trade-off between system cost and system risk in
   detail. Then, as a case study, the RAOM-UEPS is applied to the planning
   of an urban electric power system in Tianjin. Here, three scenarios are
   considered, each with different proportions of new energy resources and
   clean production levels (i.e., energy conversion efficiencies). This
   study aims to develop an urban electric power system (UEPS) optimization
   model that support the city's transformation from a coal-fired dominated
   to a low-carbon electric power mix, as well as to promote the
   sustainable development of society as a whole. The proposed model can
   facilitate a sophisticated system analysis of energy supply, electric
   power conversion, capacity expansion, and environment management over
   multiple periods. The results suggest that coal is dominant in Tianjin's
   electric power system, which was the primary air-pollutants and CO2
   contributor in electric power system. Improving clean production levels
   and the proportion of new energy resources could effectively save energy
   resources and mitigate air pollutants and CO2 emissions. These findings
   can provide a scientific basis for the sustainable development of

Abstract = {{Long-term kinematic research of slowmoving debris slide is rare despite
   of the widespread global distribution of this kind. This paper presents
   a study of the kinematics and mechanism of the Jinpingzi debris slide
   located on the Jinsha river bank in southwest China. This debris slide
   is known to have a volume of 27x10(6) m(3) in active state for at least
   one century. Field survey and geotechnical investigation were carried
   out to define the structure of the landslide. The physical and
   mechanical properties of the landslide materials were obtained by
   in-situ and laboratory tests. Additionally, surface and subsurface
   displacements, as well as groundwater level fluctuations, were monitored
   since 2005. Movement features, especially the response of the landslide
   movement to rainfall, were analysed. Relationships between resisting
   forces and driving forces were analysed by using the limit equilibrium
   method assuming rigid-plastic frictional slip. The results confirmed a
   viscous component in the long-term continuous movement resulting in the
   quasioverconsolidated state of the slip zone with higher strength
   parameters than some other types of slowmoving landslides. Both surface
   and subsurface displacements showed an advancing pattern by the straight
   outwardly inclined (rather than gently or reversely inclined) slip zone,
   which resulted in low resistance to the entire sliding mass. The average
   surface displacement rate from 2005 to 2016 was estimated to be 0.190.87
   mm/d. Basal sliding on the silty clay seam accounted for most of the
   deformation with different degrees of internal deformation in different
   parts. Rainfall was the predominant factor affecting the kinematics of
   Jinpingzi landslide while the role of groundwater level, though
   positive, was not significant. The response of the groundwater level to
   rainfall infiltration was not apparent. Unlike some shallow slow-moving
   earth flows or mudslides, whose behaviors are directly related to the
   phreatic groundwater level, the mechanism for Jinpingzi landslide
   kinematics is more likely related to the changing weight of the sliding
   mass and the downslope seepage pressure in the shallow soil mass
   resulting from rainfall events.}},

Abstract = {{The B2 talus slide at the Jin'an Bridge hydropower station is located on
   the left bank of the Jinsha River and very close to the left abutment of
   the dam. The stability of the dam is directly influenced by the
   engineering geological properties, formation mechanisms, and failure
   modes of the B2 talus slide. This paper highlights the investigation and
   analysis of the in situ engineering geological conditions of the slide
   area. The results indicate that the B2 talus slide is composed of three
   parts: the talus deposits consisting of a soil-rock mixture (SRM) in the
   upper part, unloaded and relaxed rock mass in the middle part, and
   bedrock with several tuff interlayers in the lower part. Based on
   topographic and geomorphologic analyses, the structure of the rock and
   soil, distribution characteristics, formation mechanisms, and
   influencing factors, the strength of the SRM in the upper part and the
   properties of the tuff interlayer in the lower part are the main factors
   affecting the stability of the slide. Additionally, the failure modes of
   the slide are likely to be circular in nature in the talus deposits,
   broken line sliding along the interface between the unloaded and relaxed
   rock and the upper boundary of the tuff and broken line sliding along
   the tuff interlayer. The strength parameters of the SRM and the tuff
   interlayer were obtained through laboratory experiments and theoretical
   inverse analyses. Additionally, a three-dimensional geological model of
   the slide was created using the aforementioned results and the software
   GoCAD. Limit equilibrium and finite element methods were used to
   evaluate the stability of the slide using two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional models. The results indicate that the slope is stable
   under natural conditions. However, the slope may be unstable, under
   special conditions, such as artificial excavation, flood discharge
   atomization, rainstorms, and earthquakes.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years new hydroelectric dam projects in Brazil have led to
   intense debate across society. A range of different social actors have
   been engaged in these controversies, all of them deploying different

   hydroelectric projects in the Cuenca del Alto Parana River, and examines
   the way the multiple arguments emanating from the social actors are
   grouped together. On the basis of a content analysis of qualitative
   interviews a factor analysis was carried out to identify the groups of
   arguments. One of the main outcomes of this analysis highlighted the
   discursive isolation of a single social group - the people affected by
   the construction of the dams - in contrast to the other actors, who
   shared arguments grounded in techno-economic rationales. As opposed to
   this, those affected by the dam projects used arguments based on their
   emotions, identities and daily experiences of place; their perspectives
   were absent from the discourses of other actors.}},

Abstract = {{Located in northern Quebec, Canada, eight hydroelectric reservoirs of a
   9782-km(2) maximal area cover 6.4\% of the La Grande watershed. This
   study investigates the changes brought by the impoundment of these
   reservoirs on seasonal climate and precipitation recycling. Two 30-year
   climate simulations, corresponding to pre- and post-impoundment
   conditions, were used. They were generated with the fifth-generation
   Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5), fully coupled to a 1D lake
   model (FLake). Seasonal temperatures and annual energy budget were
   generally well reproduced by the model, except in spring when a cold
   bias, probably related to the overestimation of snow cover, was seen.
   The difference in 2-m temperature shows that reservoirs induce localized
   warming in winter (+0.7 +/- 0.02 A degrees C) and cooling in the summer
   (-0.3 +/- 0.02 A degrees C). The available energy at the surface
   increases throughout the year, mostly due to a decrease in surface
   albedo. Fall latent and sensible heat fluxes are enhanced due to
   additional energy storage and availability in summer and spring. The
   changes in precipitation and runoff are within the model internal
   variability. At the watershed scale, reservoirs induce an additional
   evaporation of only 5.9 mm year(-1) (2\%). We use Brubaker's
   precipitation recycling model to estimate how much of the precipitation
   is recycled within the watershed. In both simulations, the maximal
   precipitation recycling occurs in July (less than 6\%), indicating weak
   land-atmosphere coupling. Reservoirs do not seem to affect this
   coupling, as precipitation recycling only decreased by 0.6\% in July.}},

Abstract = {{Technology transfer is essential for transitioning to a low carbon
   economy which can include hydropower. Chinese dam developers allegedly
   dominate the global hydropower industry. Studies have been carried out
   on technology transfer in their undertakings in Africa and Asia.
   However, such work is lacking for Europe and Latin America. The aim of
   this paper is to identify the extent, drivers and inhibitors of
   technology transfer of Chinese dam developers' undertakings in Europe
   and Latin America. We find relatively few Chinese undertakings and thus
   limited evidence for technology transfer both in Europe and Latin
   America. Transfers identified are frequently mutual with the Chinese
   player transferring technology to the host country and vice versa. This
   transfer is driven by business considerations in Europe (costs,
   capacities) and Latin America (costs, lacking access to finance), but
   also geopolitical ones (Europe: creation of a trading area; Latin
   America: access to (natural) resources). It is impeded by Chinese dam
   developers' poor reputation regarding safeguards as well as (only in
   Latin America) protectionist policies and significant capacities of host
   country players. Our research provides transparency regarding the
   European and Latin American hydropower industry, while also highlighting
   that attempts to influence what kind of technology is transferred by
   Chinese dam developers may be worthwhile.}},

Abstract = {{In sub-Saharan Africa, water resources are scarce and subject to
   competing uses - especially for agricultural production, energy
   generation, and ecosystem services. These water intensive activities in
   the Usangu plains and the Ruaha National Park in southern Tanzania,
   present a typical case for such water competition at the
   water-energy-food nexus. To decipher the coupled human-nature
   interactions in the Great Ruaha River basin and effectively communicate
   the results to non-technical practitioners, the water-energy-food nexus
   competition in the system is simulated using an advanced water system
   modeling approach and findings are visualized via interactive web-based
   tools (Data-Driven Document, D3) that foster fuller understanding of the
   findings for both practitioners and stakeholders. Our results indicate
   that a combination of infrastructural and procedural measures, each
   acceptable from a social and economic perspective, and understanding
   that zero flows cannot be totally eliminated during dry years in the
   Ruaha National Park, are likely to be the best way forward. This study
   also reveals that the combination of improvements in irrigation
   efficiency, cutbacks on proposed expansion of irrigated lands, and a low
   head weir at the wetland outlet, significantly reduces the number of
   zero flow days (i.e., increasing ecosystem function), resulting in
   positive effects on agricultural sector from limited (if any) reduction
   in rice crop yields. These upstream measures are all relatively cost
   efficient and can combine to free-up resources for other economic
   activity downstream (i.e. more stable hydropower production). (C) 2017

Abstract = {{With continuous population increase and economic growth, challenges on
   securing sufficient energy, water, and food supplies are amplifying.
   Water plays the most important role in the energy-water-food (E-W-F)
   nexus issue such as energy supply (clean hydropower energy generation),
   water supply (drinking water), and food supply (agricultural irrigation
   water). Therefore, water quantity simulation \& forecasting become an
   important issue in E-W-F nexus problem. Water quantity simulation \&
   forecasting model, such as rainfall-runoff (RR) hydrological model has
   become a useful tool which can significantly improve efficiency of the
   hydropower energy generation, water supply management, and agricultural
   irrigation water utilization. The accuracy and reliability of the water
   quantity simulation \& forecasting model are significantly affected by
   the model parameters. Therefore, demand of effective and fast model
   parameter optimization tool for solving the E-W-F nexus problem
   increases significantly. The shuffled complex evolution developed at
   University of Arizona (SCE-UA) has been recognized as an effective
   global model parameter optimization method for more than 20 years and is
   highly suited to solve the E-W-F nexus problem. However, the
   computational efficiency of the SCE-UA dramatically deteriorates when
   applied to complex E-W-F nexus problem. For the purpose of solving this
   conundrum, a fast parallel SCE-UA was proposed in this paper. The
   parallel SCE-UA was implemented on the novel heterogeneous computing
   hardware and software systems which were constituted by the Intel
   multi-core CPU, NVIDIA many-core GPU, and PGI Accelerator Visual Fortran
   (with OpenMP and CUDA). Performance comparisons between the parallel and
   serial SCE-UA were carried out based on two case studies, the Griewank
   benchmark function optimization and a real world IHACRES RR hydrological
   model parameter optimization. Comparison results indicated that the
   parallel SCE-UA outperformed the serial one and has good application
   prospects for solving the water quantity simulation \& forecasting model

Abstract = {{Population and economic growth pose unique challenges in securing
   sufficient water, energy, and food to meet demand at the sub-national
   (regional), national, and supra-national level. An increasing share of
   this demand is met through trade and imports. The unprecedented rapid
   growth, extent, and complexity of global value chains (GVCs) since the
   1980s have reshaped global trade. The GVCs - and new economic patterns
   of regionalization - affect the demands on water, energy, and food
   within countries and across global supply chains. East Asia is of
   particular interest due to the region's rapid economic growth,
   substantial population size, high interdependence of the region's
   economies, and varying degree of resource availability. While greater
   interdependence across the region has increased the efficiency of
   production and trade, these activities require the input of
   water-energy-food and generate disturbances in the environment. The
   transnational inter-regional input-output approach is utilized in a
   tele-connected Water Energy-Food Nexus (WEFN) analysis of the East Asia
   GVC to assess competing demands for these resources and environmental
   outcomes.
   This analysis demonstrates the hidden virtual flows of water, energy,
   and food embodied in intra-regional and transnational inter-regional
   trade. China's current national export oriented economic growth strategy
   in East Asia is not sustainable from the WEFN perspective. China is a
   net virtual exporter of nexus resources to Japan and South Korea.
   China's prioritization of economic growth and trade in low value added
   and pollution intensive sectors consumes a great amount of nexus
   resources within its territory to satisfy consumers' demands in Japan
   and South Korea. Japan's Kanto and Kinki regions and South Korea's
   Sudokwon region were the major beneficiaries while China bore the
   environmental burden associated with the production of exports. For
   example, net virtual exports from China's East region included over 1.2
   billion m(3) of scarce water and 61.3 million metric (CO2 equivalent)
   tons of greenhouse gases (i.e. CO2, NH4, and N2O) and 2 million metric
   tons of SOx emissions.
   Trade is an important mechanism for overcoming resource bottlenecks,
   but, taking into account environmental linkages, regional specialization
   is not necessarily mutually beneficial. This analysis demonstrates a
   mismatch between regional water-energy-food availability and final
   resource consumption and the lack of attention for environmental impacts
   in national economic growth strategies. Resource scarce countries like
   China must, therefore, incorporate trade-off decisions between pursuing
   national economic growth, incurring environmental degradation, and food
   security into strategic regional development policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{China's coal-based energy supply inflicts destructive damage upon the
   ecological environment, though it has simultaneously safeguarded the
   rapid development of China's economy in recent decades. To promote
   ecological recovery and accelerate the adjustment of its industrial
   structure, China is poised to fully implement a total coal consumption
   cap through the ``13th Five-year Plan{''} (2016-2020). This study
   assesses the feasibility of this strategy from the perspective of water
   resources, exploring and predicting outcomes from 2012 to 2050. After
   first measuring the water resources demands for the life-cycle of coal,
   this study then analyzes the destructive effects on water resources from
   coal production through to consumption, before finally evaluating the
   water conservation synergy effects under different plans for capped coal
   consumption. The results reveal that implementing a total coal
   consumption cap could reduce the adverse effects on the water resources
   system due to coal mining, washing, conversion, and utilization by
   comprehensively promoting conservation and protection of water
   resources. The study directly compares the two cap strategies of
   ``behave as usual{''} and ``reinforced total consumption control,{''}
   finding that neither of these strategies can totally satisfy China's
   existing requirements for water resources management. In future, China's
   total coal consumption will exceed the feasible scale of coal mining as
   restrained by total water use limits, and the required quantity of water
   for conversion and utilization of coal will also exceed its water use
   limit. Therefore, to achieve coordinated progress between the
   development of the coal-related industry and sustainable utilization of
   water resources, the Chinese government urgently needs to further
   reinforce total coal consumption controls and actively popularize the
   application of water-saving technology. In addition, the study estimates
   the damage to water resources due to China's coal consumption,
   determining the value of lost water resources per ton of coal
   consumption nationwide to be 52.76 yuan. If all of China's coal
   enterprises could apply water-preserving mining technology and make full
   use of mine water for production, the loss of water resources nationwide
   per ton of coal consumption could be lowered to 40.91 yuan. Therefore,
   the study advocates the combination of a market price adjustment
   mechanism and a macro total control strategy to maximize the synergic
   benefits between energy and water resources in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   economic and social factors in the process of human activity.
   In order to prevent the aggravation of the environmental problems, to
   prevent a potential environmental damage and destruction ecosystem of
   the Dniester in particular, the public health, as well as the economic
   foundations, not only for the Republic of Moldova and the Ukraine, but
   for the whole Black Sea region, should consolidate the efforts of all
   interested structures and actors (including the non-governmental
   sector), to block the implementation of the Ukraine hydro power
   expanding program.
   Now, the Dniester cascade of hydro power plants have already led to
   negative consequences, but the future construction of another complex of
   six hydroelectric power stations will cause even more environmental
   problems. Additional six hydroelectric power stations have been planned
   for construction in the next 10 years according to Ukrainian Government
   Program of Hydropower Development until 2026.
   The lack of basin approach in the usage of aquatic resources of this
   transboundary river, as well as the noncompliance with provisions of the
   Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and
   International Lakes can lead to an ecological catastrophe both for the
   Dniester River, Black Sea wetlands and Black Sea by itself.
   That's why in the decision making process about six hydro power plants,
   the states should achieve a harmonious combination of the three
   components of the concept of sustainable development (environmental,
   economic and social), which are closely intercconnected and only such a
   combination, would achieve the necessary balance in development.
   Taking into account the prevailing situation in the region, it is
   necessary to elaborate and adopt special convention on the Dniester
   based on a unified concept by the coastal states. Implementation of
   environmental policy of the states is not possible outside the context
   of the law-making process.}},

Abstract = {{To further remedy ecological environment, correct understanding of side
   slope stability is essential for the effective reinforcement and
   protection of rock-soil slope. Rock slope stability calculations and
   support design are largely based on the analysis of site geological
   conditions. Existing methods of geological analysis primarily involve
   phenomenon description and analysis of rock structure, and are not
   convenient for designers due to the lack of a reasonable index
   describing slope structural characteristics in the solid earth. In this
   paper, the differences and connection between slope body structure, the
   natural rock structure and slope structure are first discriminated, then
   discussed with the establishment of a slope body structure model. Slope
   body structure is established on the basis of geological investigation
   and slope analysis, taking into account factors such as the main control
   of the structural plane, comprehensive analysis of engineering
   geological petrofabric, environmental characteristics, geological
   structural features, the result of natural forces, and groundwater
   development status. Based on a summary and analysis of slope geological
   conditions at the sites of hydropower projects (both those already built
   and those under construction) in southwest China, slope body structure
   is divided into six classes and ten types, producing an ecological
   taxonomy system. This system is then employed to establish the
   corresponding relationship between slope body structure and failure
   mode, which in turn provides data for the development of a calculation
   model and selection method for the analysis of slope stability and
   support design. Finally, the environmental application value of
   determining slope body structure is described.}},

Abstract = {{The completion of Shuibuya, the last hydropower station to be
   constructed in the Qingjiang cascade, signifies China's successful
   development of the world's largest mixed cascade hydropower generation
   system. Joint operation of such cascaded hydropower stations is
   considered necessary to improve hydropower output in China. In this
   study, two modeling methods routine and optimal operations were adopted,
   based on existing rules of reservoir operation, to determine the effects
   of joint operation. To investigate the realistic and potential effects,
   the two models were computed using observed runoff data (1951-2009). The
   potential effects were identified by comparing the total hydropower
   generation two single cascades and their cogeneration. Under the routine
   operational mode, the incremental power generation of joint operation
   would be 5.73 x 10(8) kWh, an increase of 5 parts per thousand compared
   to isolated oper-. ation. However, even in isolation, if reservoir
   operation is optimized through the dynamic programming algorithm, the
   incremental power generation of the cascade would be 42.24 x 10(8) kWh,
   which is seven times that of joint operation with routine reservoir
   operation (5.73 x 10(8) kWh). The results showed that, under current
   reservoir operating rules, there is little room for improvement in
   hydropower generation, although joint operation could increase
   hydropower generation to a certain extent, especially in the reservoirs'
   refill and release stages. China must amend its existing operational
   mode for reservoirs to enhance the economic benefits of cascade
   hydropower stations. Furthermore, to meet increasing demands for both
   water and energy, carefully considered planning of constructing clusters
   of these stations is required. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   salmonids and eels past hydroelectric plants in Europe. On the basis of
   a summary of international literature, general designs and
   recommendations for best practices for fish-pass facilities are
   provided. The review is part of the Norwegian SafePass project, which
   focuses on Atlantic salmon, brown trout, grayling and European eel.
   According to recent international recommendations, many existing
   European fishways for upstream migration do not have an optimal design.
   This is especially evident for denil and pool-and-weir fishways in
   inland areas with species such as grayling and brown trout. Based on the
   review, we generally recommend (1) using ramps, nature-like channels and
   vertical-slot fishways for these species and (2) reducing water drop
   between the pools in pool-and-weir fishways and reducing energy
   dissipation compared with the design of traditional Atlantic salmon
   ladders. There are few well-functioning passages for downstream
   migration of fish in Europe and significant progress has been made in
   the past decade to improve technology and knowledge. Several
   international studies have shown that physical structures, such as
   fine-mesh trash racks with alternative escape routes and bypass
   arrangements, provide >90\% passage efficiency for downstream migration,
   especially for brown trout and salmon, and have, in recent years, shown
   good results also for silver eels.}},

Abstract = {{Hydropower plant (HPP) operation may influence downstream flow regimes,
   which can affect the fish movement. In South America, tailrace fisheries
   are often killed or injured when interacting with spillways and
   turbines. Hydrodynamic flow-pattern studies are essential to facilitate
   mitigation. We developed a computational fluid dynamics model to
   investigate flow downstream of Tres Marias HPP (Brazil). Included in the
   model were the draft tubes, tailrace and a 3-km river reach. We
   simulated a common scenario consisting of three active turbines on the
   right side of the powerhouse (109.6, 108.0 and 108.0 m(3) s(-1)) and
   three inactive turbines, by using Ansys Fluent (ver. 12). We identified
   a straight discharge plume from the right-most turbine that was
   constrained by the right-side wall. Further, there was the generation of
   significant plumes from Turbines 2 and 3. The maximum velocities in
   these plumes appears not to be a barrier for Pimelodus maculatus and
   Prochilodus costatus, because their prolonged swimming speeds for their
   maximum total length were higher than the modelled velocities. The
   results will support mitigation decisions such as fish passage and
   turbine-screen design in this particular HPP and may be a model for
   further studies in the South America.}},

Title = {{A Novel Method for Economic Dispatch with Across Neighborhood Search: A
   Case Study in a Provincial Power Grid, China}},
Journal = {{COMPLEXITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Abstract = {{Economic dispatch (ED) is of cardinal significance for the power system
   operation. It is mathematically a typical complex nonlinear
   multivariable strongly coupled optimization problem with equality and
   inequality constraints, especially considering the valve-point effects.
   In order to effectively solve the problem, a simple yet very young and
   efficient population-based algorithm named across neighborhood search
   (ANS) is implemented in this paper. In ANS, a group of individuals
   collaboratively navigate through the search space for obtaining the
   optimal solution by simultaneously searching the neighborhoods of
   multiple superior solutions. Four benchmark test cases with diverse
   complexities and characteristics are firstly employed to comprehensively
   verify the feasibility and effectiveness of ANS. The experimental and
   comparison results fully demonstrate the superiority of ANS in terms of
   the final solution quality, convergence speed, robustness, and
   statistics. In addition, the sensitivities of ANS to variations of
   population size and across-search degree are studied. Furthermore, ANS
   is applied to a practical provincial power grid of China. All the
   comparison results consistently indicate that ANS is highly competitive
   and can be used as a promising alternative for ED problems.}},

Title = {{Stability Assessment of the Excavated Rock Slope at the Dagangshan
   Hydropower Station in China Based on Microseismic Monitoring}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{2018}},
Abstract = {{A high-resolution microseismic (MS) monitoring system was implemented at
   the right bank slope of the Dagangshan hydropower station in May 2010 to
   analyse the slope stability subjected to continuous excavation. The MS
   monitoring system could real-time capture a large number of seismic
   events occurring inside the rock slope. The identification and
   delineation of rock mass damage subject to excavation and consolidation
   grouting can be conducted based on the analysis of tempospatial
   distribution of MS events. However, how to qualitatively evaluate the
   stability of the rock slope by utilizing these MS data remains
   challenging. A damage model based on MS data was proposed to analyse the
   rock mass damage, and a 3D finite element method model of the rock slope
   was also established. The deteriorated mechanical parameters of rock
   mass were determined according to the model elements considering the
   effect of MS damage. With this method, we can explore the effect of MS
   activities, which are caused by rock mass damage subjected to excavation
   and strength degradation to the dynamic instability of the slope. When
   the MS damage effect was taken into account, the safety factor of the
   rock slope was reduced by 0.18 compared to the original rock slope model
   without considering the effect. The simulated results show that MS
   activities, which are subjected to excavation unloading, have only a
   limited effect on the stability of the right bank slope. The proposed
   method is proven to be a better approach for the dynamical assessment of
   rock slope stability and will provide valuable references for other
   similar rock slopes.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, CO2 emissions from cascade hydropower reservoirs are not well

   partial pressure (pCO(2)) and related environmental factors in 4
   cascading reservoirs (Hong Jia Du, Dong Feng, Suo Feng Ying, and Wu
   Jiang Du) of Wujiang River, southwest China. The results showed that
   pCO(2) in the surface water of these reservoirs had obvious
   spatiotemporal changes and generally decreased from the riverine zone to
   the lacustrine zone in each reservoir. In summer, pCO(2) was highest
   downstream of the dam because of stratification and deep water discharge
   for hydropower generation, whereas pCO(2) was much lower in the surface
   water of the lacustrine zone because of carbon removal by
   photosynthesis. When water temperature was low, however, pCO(2) was
   higher in the surface water of the lacustrine zone because of
   respiration and organic decomposition. Among these reservoirs, only Suo
   Feng Ying had CO2 emissions higher than the average value of natural
   lakes. In addition, CO2 emission flux showed an exponentially negative
   relationship with hydraulic retention time of reservoirs, based on this
   work and other reports of reservoirs in the Yangtze River basin.}},

Abstract = {{The damming of rivers results in hydrological modifications that not

   ecological problems, including decreased water turbidity and loss of
   biodiversity, which potentially influence ecosystem net primary
   production (NPP) and hence the sequestration, transformation, and
   storage of carbon. We used terrestrial NPP (NPPT) as a bioindicator to
   assess the impact of dams on carbon storage in the Wujiang catchment.
   MODIS satellite and meteorological data were used as inputs to the CASA
   model to calculate annual NPPT from 2000 to 2014. NPPT was calculated at
   the catchment and landscape scale to quantify the impact of dams on
   surrounding terrestrial ecosystems. Mean NPPT was calculated for
   concentric buffer zones covering a range of spatial extents (0-10 km)
   from the reservoir shoreline.We found a negligible impact from
   construction of a single dam on NPPT at the catchment scale. By
   contrast, the impact of dam construction was scale-dependent, with a
   stronger landscape-scale effect observed at short distances (i.e., 0-1
   km) from the reservoir. Decreases in NPPT were mainly ascribed to the
   loss of vegetated land resulting from dam impoundment and subsequent
   urbanization of the surrounding area.}},

Abstract = {{The Madeira River, which drains one of the major tributary river basins
   of the upper Amazon, contributes to small-scale fisheries in Peru,
   Bolivia, and Brazil. This paper provides a base-line of fisheries
   resources and their status in six sub-basins of the Madeira River: upper
   Madre de Dios River basin (Peru), Beni and Mamore River basins
   (Bolivia), Itenez or Guapore River basin (Bolivia and Brazil), middle
   Madeira, and (two sections of the) lower Madeira River (Brazil). Data
   were collected between 2009 and 2011, before the completion of two
   hydroelectric dams in the Brazilian portion of the basin. Biophysical,
   social, and biological indicators were used to characterize the
   fisheries. The results show an overall small-scale multispecies
   fisheries pattern but with notorious differences between the Madeira
   sub-basins. The Beni and Mamore sub-basin shows the largest flooded
   area, with associated higher total fisheries yields. Trophic level of
   the catch, diversity, and mean weight of fish caught were shown to be
   very sensitive to exploitation level, river water type (white or clear
   water), flooded area, and the introduction of Arapaima gigas in Bolivia.
   The Bolivian fisheries are characterized by less exploited stocks,
   whereas stocks in Peru and Brazil show signs of intensive exploitation,
   resulting in fisheries of smaller bodied, lower trophic-level species.
   Landing data in the upper basin show a predominant reliance on migrating
   fish resources, which might be vulnerable to the construction of dams.
   These data serve as a baseline to evaluate anthropogenic impacts on the
   Madeira River basin fisheries in the future.}},

Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Wind energy integration is a complex target that could refer to
   different aspects such as: grid capacity; power system; support scheme;
   environmental; social issues; etc. It is probably the less predictable
   renewable energy sources (RES) due to its high volatility being
   difficult to be securely integrated into the power systems. This paper
   will focus on the wind energy integration from the power system point of
   view, emphasizing the case of Romania. Before going into the Romanian
   case, the paper analyzes the potential benefits of the regional approach
   in terms of power system integration, revealing that it can bring
   significant advantages by reducing the required power reserves or
   increasing wind power plants (WPP) generation. Currently, the power
   system integration is one of the major obstacle to large scale wind
   energy penetration in the region of Southeast (SE) Europe with high wind
   energy potential. The results of our research consist in proposing a
   model for estimating the balancing reserves sharing at regional level,
   comparing regional to country-by-country approach in terms of the power
   reserve requirements for balancing the operation of WPP. It definitely
   reveals that by regional Transmission System Operators (TSO)
   coordination; less reserves are needed; therefore, the space for RES
   enlarges. We also propose a model for Romanian power system that is able
   to calculate the installed power of WPP that could operate without
   considerable interruptions. Also, the model estimates the additional
   power reserves required for larger wind energy integration. This
   perspective can provide interesting insights on what should be foreseen
   as reasonable behavior of the policy makers and investors.}},

Abstract = {{The use of hydropower has expanded in recent years in southwest China,
   playing a key role in the success of China's West-to-East energy
   strategy. Although installed hydropower capacity has reached a record
   high, the problem of abandoned water has intensified and has been
   gradually highlighted by researchers. Abandoned water has resulted in a
   significant waste of carbon-free and inexpensive renewable energy, which
   is not conducive to China's goals to reduce emissions to save energy.
   This waste has seriously affected the development of China's hydropower
   industry. Therefore, now is the time to analyze the main reasons for the
   abandoned water problem and to identify the crux of the problem. In this
   paper, we collected the actual operation data of all the power stations
   in the case area and established the mathematical model according to the
   quantity of abandoned water as well as the actual and the theoretical
   output curve of the power station to quantify the abandoned water into
   energy loss. We then classified the abandoned water according to three
   groups of causes, namely, generation-side, line-side, and market-side
   causes. In 2016, the total energy loss of abandoned water of Sichuan
   Province was 28.73 x 10(9) kW h, of which the generation-, line-, and
   market-side causes account for 7.76\%, 11.68\%, and 80.56\% of the
   energy loss, respectively. Therefore, the market-side causes are the
   main cause for the abandoned water problem. Such market-side causes
   primarily include the imbalance between electricity supply and demand,
   the provincial barriers of the local government system and its
   mechanisms, and the hysteresis congestion of the transmission lines.
   Seizing the favorable opportunity presented by new power system reforms
   in China, this study proposes several market-oriented measures to
   improve hydropower consumption capacity. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

   generation pose substantial challenges to the sustainable development of

   Five-Year Plan of electricity development, this study quantified annual
   water withdrawal and consumption for future electricity generation in
   China from 2015 to 2030. This study simulated a three-prong approach to
   impacting water use for electricity development, i.e., updating the
   cooling technology mix, increasing non-thermal power generation and
   relocating thermal power plants to the west. The results showed that
   solutions to relieve water stress caused by electricity production
   entail major trade-offs. Annual water withdrawal and consumption were
   projected to exceed 63.75 and 8.30 billion m(3) by 2030, up
   approximately 14\% and 21\% of those in 2015, respectively, if China
   does not implement any new water and energy policies. Replacing
   once-through cooling systems with closed-loop cooling systems would
   decrease national water withdrawal remarkably but increase water
   consumption. The west-centered spatial distribution of thermoelectric
   power generation would reduce water use at the national level; however,
   it will largely increase water stress in northern and northwestern
   China. Thus, relieving the stress of growing electricity demand on water
   resources in China requires comprehensive measures and quantitative

   streams and increased withdrawals from surface water reservoirs.
   Withdrawals have also been increasing as a result of growth in irrigated
   agriculture. A hydrologic modeling approach on a watershed scale was
   used to analyze the long-term implications of these factors and to
   quantitatively assess the trade-offs between water supply and food

Abstract = {{In the last few years, the water-energy nexus concept has emerged as a
   global issue. However, studies on European countries are relatively few,
   and often focused on agriculture. Cooling purposes represent the main
   part of industrial water demand, and waste-heat recovery is a main
   strategy to improve resource efficiency. This paper presents a real case
   study of low-temperature waste-heat recovery in an electric steelmaking
   industry and evaluates the impact of feasible interventions on primary
   energy and water consumption, as well as on CO2 equivalent emissions.
   Based on a Europe wide review of energy and water prices, of energy
   sources and corresponding resource efficiency indicators, a Monte Carlo
   model was developed to undertake a generalization of the case study to
   the EU-15. It was found that solutions with the lowest primary energy
   demand and the lowest CO2 equivalent emissions demonstrate the greatest
   water footprint. This is the case of some southern European countries,
   where heat recovery projects with the highest water intensity are
   feasible due to high electricity and low water prices. As increasing
   carbon prices may exacerbate this phenomenon, inducing a switch to water
   intensive technologies, incentives to carbon emission reduction should
   be carefully designed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is projected to increase hydropower generation in some
   parts of the world and decrease it in others. Here we explore the
   possible consequences of these impacts for the electricity supply sector
   at the global scale. Regional hydropower projections are developed by
   forcing a coupled global hydrological and dam model with downscaled,
   bias-corrected climate realizations. Consequent impacts on power sector
   composition and associated emissions and investment costs are explored
   using the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). We find that
   climate-driven changes in hydropower generation may shift power demands
   onto and away from carbon intensive technologies. This causes
   significantly altered power sector CO2 emissions in several
   hydro-dependent regions, although the net global impact is modest. For
   drying regions, we estimate a global, cumulative investment need of
   approximately one trillion dollars (+/-\$500 billion) this century to
   make up for deteriorated hydropower generation caused by climate change.
   Total investments avoided are of a similar magnitude across regions
   projected to experience increased precipitation. Investment risks and
   opportunities are concentrated in hydro dependent countries for which
   significant climate change is expected. Various countries throughout the
   Balkans, Latin America and Southern Africa are most vulnerable, whilst
   Norway, Canada, and Bhutan emerge as clear beneficiaries. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Maintaining water availability and electric energy production are the
   major concerns for the future in countries which are extremely dependent
   on their water resources like Brazil. The objective of this study was to
   assess the impacts of climate change on streamflow and therefore on
   hydropower potential of the Grande river basin headwater region,
   Southeast Brazil. For this purpose, the SWAT model was used to simulate
   the hydrological behaviour of the headwaters under the Representative
   Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, obtained from the Regional
   Climate Models Eta-HadGEM-ES and Eta-MIROC5 between the years 2007 and
   2099. Through power duration curves we estimated the hypothetical
   average annual energy production at three hydropower plants installed in
   cascade in the region, being, from upstream to downstream, Camargos,
   Itutinga and Funil. These plants account for a potential of 277 MW. SWAT
   was able to simulate the streamflow of the Grande river basin headwaters
   and, therefore, to reproduce the observed monthly streamflow from the
   baseline period (1961-2005) reasonably well for all three hydropower
   plants. In general, the results indicated a significant streamflow
   reduction and therefore reductions in runoff during all the simulated
   periods and all radiative forcing analysed, when compared to the
   baseline period. Thus, these results led to reductions in hydropower
   potential and hence decreases of the annual energy production varying
   from 6.1 to 58.6\% throughout the 21st Century.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-impoundment clearance in an area to be flooded by a reservoir is a
   commonly applied engineering measure to remove vegetation cover,
   buildings, structures and solid waste landfill as a clean production
   approach in the hydropower industry. By removing forests and trees,
   pre-impoundment clearance is also among one of the most applicable and
   practical measures to significantly minimize the potential increase in
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions after reservoir impoundment. By using
   Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) method and
   following ISO 14067, the present study evaluated carbon footprints of
   pre-impoundment clearance in China's five largest hydro-projects: the
   Three Gorges Dam Project (TGD), the Xiangjiaba Project, the Xiluodu
   Project, the Baihetan Project, and the Wudongde Project, and discussed
   the trade-offs between these carbon footprints and the contributions to
   GHG emission reductions from pre-impoundment clearance. The carbon
   footprints of pre-impoundment clearance in these hydro-projects ranged
   from 0.020 gCO(2eq).kWh(-1) to 0.434 gCO(2eq).kWh(-1); the TGD project
   had the maximum carbon footprint among the hydro-projects. Removal of
   buildings, structures, and solid wastes created the largest share (over
   95\%) of carbon footprints of pre-impoundment clearance. Removal of
   forests and trees in pre-impoundment clearance could possibly reduce
   potential GHG emissions after reservoir impoundment, which equal to
   approximately 14.43\%-246.80\% of pre-impoundment clearance. Higher
   anthropogenic activity in terms of population density in reservoir areas
   to be flooded and smaller hydro-project energy density resulted in
   higher carbon footprints from pre-impoundment clearance. In China's
   cases, pre-impoundment clearance is concluded to be a significant
   measure of GHG emission reduction in hydropower industry. (C) 2017

Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{71-82}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Caatinga is a typical seasonally dry forest with a fine-tuned
   adaptation to the climatic conditions of the Brazilian semi-arid region
   and has been frequently replaced by grassland. As the effects of this
   replacement on CO2, water and energy fluxes are still unknown,
   simultaneous measurements of such fluxes are essential to understand the
   possible feedback cycles associated with the seasonal functioning of
   these ecosystems, and assessing the consequences of global changes. The
   aim of this study was to measure the CO2, water and energy fluxes in the
   Caatinga and grassland in the semi-arid region of Brazil. The
   measurements were made using the eddy covariance method in Pernambuco
   State, Brazil. The soil storage water (SSW) and normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) were also determined. The sensible heat flux (H)
   was the main consumer of the available energy and was higher in the
   grassland. Based on an analysis of the decoupling factor, in the dry
   season evapotranspiration (ET) was controlled by vegetation, and it was
   controlled by atmospheric conditions in the wet season. ET over the
   Caatinga (1.4 mm d(-1)) was higher than over the grassland (0.8 mm
   d(-1)). The Caatinga and grassland acted as atmospheric carbon sources
   during drier periods with lower NDVI, and as carbon sinks during wetter
   periods with higher NDVI. During the dry season, the Caatinga stored
   more carbon than the grassland, while the inverse occurred in the wet
   season. Thus, land use change from Caatinga to grassland will tend to
   increase H and to decrease ET, but the CO2 fluxes will be similar. (C)

Abstract = {{Rapid urbanization drives the expansion of urban power girds, which
   involves enormous energy intensive products such as steel and concrete
   and inevitably results in a great quantity of carbon emissions. However,
   little has been done to investigate urban power girds' impact on carbon
   emissions. To solve this problem, this study makes efforts to calculate
   the carbon emissions of urban power grid in Jing-Jin-Ji region, one of
   the most populous and economically dynamic regions in China, in light o
   f the hybrid method. Moreover, the depreciation life of urban power
   grids is taken into consideration for the first time, which avoids the
   underestimation of the accumulated carbon emissions of urban power grid
   due to depreciation. The results show that the accumulated carbon
   emissions o f urban power grid in Jing-Jin-Ji region are 2.71E+06 t CO2
   eq. in 1993. When it comes to 2014, this figure increases by over 7.2
   times. The majority of the carbon emissions by typical urban substations
   and transmission line projects are contributed by electrical equipment,
   steel and construction industries. 4 scenarios are set to predict the
   future carbon emissions by power grids in Jing-Jin-Ji region. The
   highest accumulated carbon emissions in 2020 are projected to be
   7.63E+07 t CO2 eq. under the condition shortest depreciation life (SDL)

   carried out to show some influential factors such GDP's influence on

Abstract = {{Energy and water issues are interrelated and have significant impacts on
   the economy. The amount and intensity of energy and water consumption
   must be controlled, which was clearly stated in the ``11th Five-Year{''}
   Plan and ``12th Five-Year{''} Plan. The energy-water nexus is a useful
   approach to integrate economic sectors. Energy production consumes large
   inputs of energy and water, while producing most of the energy required
   by other sectors. This synergy between energy conservation and water
   saving in energy sectors is intricate. This study assesses the
   synergistic effect between energy conservation and water saving that has
   been achieved by energy sectors in China during the 2007-2012 period.
   The research results suggest that energy sectors have completely
   achieved 12.40 x 10(8) m(3) water saving through energy conservation and
   1.12 x 10(6) tce energy conservation through water saving. Coal, oil and
   gas production mainly consumed water in indirect ways, while electricity
   generation primarily consumed water in a direct way. The synergistic
   energy conservation of the electric power sector was significant and was
   much larger than that of the coal production sector as well as oil and
   gas production sector. Prominent water saving can be obtained through
   improved energy conservation in China's energy sectors.}},

Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{24-35}},

Abstract = {{The Brazilian government has plans to build 26 large hydropower plants
   in the Amazon basin between 2013 and 2028. These plants will have a
   total installed capacity of 44 GW, 9000 km(2) of reservoir area, and a
   total cost of US\$ 30-70 billion. In this paper we aim to evaluate
   alternative generation pathways to avoid the adverse social and
   environmental impacts associated with reservoirs in the Amazon.
   Specifically we model the Brazilian electricity network under five
   capacity expansion scenarios. We assumed the government expansion plans
   as the baseline and created alternative scenarios where wind and natural
   gas power plants replace large Amazonian hydropower plants. We compared
   the scenarios using several performance indicators: greenhouse gas
   emissions, land use, capital and operational costs, wind curtailments,
   and energy storage in the hydropower reservoirs. The simulations suggest
   that a more aggressive policy towards wind generation than the baseline
   has the potential to replace Amazon hydropower providing advantages to
   the system operation (e.g., higher storage in hydropower reservoirs).
   However, when installedwind capacity reaches 24\% to 28\% of the total
   installed capacity, more thermal generation is required to balance the
   hydro-wind variability, increasing the operational costs and greenhouse
   gas emissions compared to the baseline. (C) 2017 International Energy

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{953-964}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Taiwan Strait has recently been proposed as a promising site for
   dynamic tidal power systems because of its shallow depth and strong
   tides. Dynamic tidal power is a new concept for extracting tidal
   potential energy in which a coast-perpendicular dike is used to create
   water head and generate electricity via turbines inserted in the dike.
   Before starting such a project, the potential power output and
   hydrodynamic impacts of the dike must be assessed. In this study, a
   two-dimensional numerical model based on the Delft3D-FLOW module is
   established to simulate tides in China. A dike module is developed to
   account for turbine processes and estimate power output by integrating a
   special algorithm into the model. The domain decomposition technique is
   used to divide the computational zone into two subdomains with grid
   refinement near the dike. The hydrodynamic processes predicted by the
   model, both with and without the proposed construction, are examined in
   detail, including tidal currents and tidal energy flux. The predicted
   time-averaged power yields with various opening ratios are presented.
   The results show that time-averaged power yield peaks at an 8\% opening
   ratio. For semidiurnal tides, the flow velocity increases in front of
   the head of the dike and decreases on either side. For diurnal tides,
   these changes are complicated by the oblique incidence of tidal currents
   with respect to the dike as well as by bathymetric features. The dike
   itself blocks the propagation of tidal energy flux.}},

Abstract = {{Small hydro projects (SHPs) are considered to be more eco-friendly as

   minimum harmful effects on flora and fauna. But still, in the western
   Himalayan region, these SHPs are under the radar of environmentalists
   and local communities because these projects sometimes cause the
   long-term negative impact on the environment due to lack of proper

Abstract = {{Accurate simulation of energy, water, and carbon fluxes exchanging
   between the land surface and the atmosphere is beneficial for improving
   terrestrial ecohydrological and climate predictions. We systematically
   assessed the Noah land surface model (LSM) with mutiparameterization
   options (Noah-MP) in simulating these fluxes and associated variations
   in terrestrial water storage (TWS) and snow cover fraction (SCF) against
   various reference products over 18 United States Geological Survey
   two-digital hydrological unit code regions of the continental United
   States (CONUS). In general, Noah-MP captures better the observed
   seasonal and interregional variability of net radiation, SCF, and runoff
   than other variables. With a dynamic vegetation model, it overestimates
   gross primary productivity by 40\% and evapotranspiration (ET) by 22\%
   over the whole CONUS domain; however, with a prescribed climatology of
   leaf area index, it greatly improves ET simulation with relative bias
   dropping to 4\%. It accurately simulates regional TWS dynamics in most
   regions except those with large lakes or severely affected by irrigation
   and/or impoundments. Incorporating the lake water storage variations
   into the modeled TWS variations largely reduces the TWS simulation bias
   more obviously over the Great Lakes with model efficiency increasing
   from 0.18 to 0.76. Noah-MP simulates runoff well in most regions except
   an obvious overestimation (underestimation) in the Rio Grande and Lower
   Colorado (New England). Compared with North American Land Data
   Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) LSMs, Noah-MP shows a better
   ability to simulate runoff and a comparable skill in simulating R-n but
   a worse skill in simulating ET over most regions. This study suggests
   that future model developments should focus on improving the
   representations of vegetation dynamics, lake water storage dynamics, and
   human activities including irrigation and impoundments.}},

Abstract = {{The North China Plain, with a population of approximately 150 million,

   Moreover, we evaluate the energy-saving effect of SNWDP on groundwater
   exploitation based on the groundwater-exploitation reduction program
   implemented by the Chinese government. Our results show that the
   transferred water will replace about 2.97 billion m(3) of exploited
   groundwater in the water reception area by 2020 and hence reduce energy
   consumption by 931 million kWh. Further, by 2030, 6.44 billion m3 of

Abstract = {{The systematic study of the relationship between energy production and

   explores the causal relationship between energy production and water

   cointegration test, vector error correction model (VECM) and Granger
   causality approaches to examine the long-run and short-run relationship
   between the variables. The results show that: (1) There is a long run
   bidirectional Granger causality relationship between energy production
   and water resources utilization, but a short-run unidirectional
   relationship between two variables, i.e. the water resource utilization
   is the short-run Granger reason for the change in energy production; (2)
   the increases in industrial added value, population and ratio of the
   secondary industry value added to GDP have a positive effect on both
   energy production and water resource utilization; (3) industrial water
   use will fall by about 0.12\% if the rate of industrial waste-water
   reuse increases by 1\%, which shows that the progress of water-saving

Abstract = {{Jiuzhaigou Valley (JZG) has been rated as World Heritage, National
   Nature Reserves and world-class places of interests, due to its
   fantastic beauty of water. In recent years, however, JZG is losing its
   beauty with runoff decreasing and stream drying up. An increase of
   evapotranspiration (ET) over the rehabilitating forest is assumed to be
   the main reason for runoff decreasing, however, this assumption remained
   untested for lack of long-term observing data. To test this assumption,
   a long-term field experiment was carried out from August 2013 to
   December 2015 in JZG over a typical secondary forest. Meteorological
   parameters and energy fluxes were measured by eddy covariance system,
   soil moisture by time-domain reflectometry probes, and ET by eddy
   covariance method and soil water budget. Results showed that (1) despite
   the limitation of high elevation, high atmospheric humidity and low
   annual air temperature, annual ET was quite large. It was 700 mm and 739
   mm, respectively for 2014 and 2015, while the corresponding
   precipitation (P) was 1003 mm and 782 mm. ET/P was close or over 1,
   which meant that P was mostly used for forest ET and only a very small
   proportion of P contributed to runoff. (2) The ratio of latent heat flux
   (LE) to net radiation (R-n) was 0.69 and 0.75 in the growing season of
   2014 and 2015, respectively. These high LE/R-n ratio values were
   considerably higher in JZG than in other areas of the Tibetan Plateau,
   which could be attributed to better forest rehabilitation in JZG. Our
   results also showed that ET at the forest site was limited by available
   energy. We conclude that ET in JZG was energy limited, whereas forest ET
   consumed most precipitation. (3) The above assumption is verified to be
   true. The high ET rate after forest rehabilitation in JZG comes at a
   cost of decreasing runoff and leads to streams drying up. These results
   will be useful for sustainable managements of water and forest in JZG.}},

Abstract = {{Given the pursuit of long-term decarbonisation targets, future power
   systems face the task of integrating the renewable power and providing
   flexible backup production capacity. Due to its general ability to be
   dispatched, hydropower offers unique features and a backup production
   option not to be neglected, especially when taking the flexibility
   potential of multireservoir systems into account. Adequate hydropower
   representations are a necessity when analysing future power markets and
   aggregation methods are crucial for overcoming computational challenges.
   However, a major issue is that the aggregation must not be a too
   flexible representation. In a first step, a novel equivalent hydro
   system model implementation including a possibility to integrate pumping
   capacity and appropriate handling of multiple water paths (hydraulic
   coupling) by making use of an ex-ante optimisation is proposed. In a
   second step, a clustered equivalent hydro systemmodel implementation

   aggregation approaches against the detailed reference system shows that
   both aggregated model variants yield significant reductions in
   computation time while keeping an adequate level of accuracy for a

   variables of a power system contain information regarding the status of
   power system security. Therefore, in order to overcome the complexity

Volume = {{165}},

Abstract = {{Power systems are bound to experience a long transition process, which
   involves not only changes in technology but also changes in user
   practices, regulations, industrial networks, infrastructures, and
   cultures. There are conflicts among these factors on account of the
   mutual uncoordinated changes, which would hinder the development of
   power systems. Therefore, keeping permanent coordination of numerous
   factors is a great challenge for the power system evolution. Current
   evaluation methods of power system evolution do not pay sufficient
   attention to the co-evolution of factors, particularly for technology,
   society, finance and policy, as well as insight from innovation studies
   and the sociology of technology. Hence, we propose a new index:
   co-evolution entropy, which can indicate the positive negative entropy
   interaction coordinating system evolution. Then, based on
   socio-technical system, we identify 14 factors participating in the
   evolution of power system from three layers: landscape, regime and
   niche. Finally, we apply this index to China's electricity domain for
   identifying the evolution obstacles of non-coordinates, and propose a
   strategy to improve the system's co-evolution. Results show that (1) the
   change in co-evolution entropy from different layers has different
   characteristics; for example, the landscape mainly possesses negative
   entropy, but the regime holds positive entropy. (2) The power system's
   co-evolution entropy changes from 0.043 to 0.154, and reaches the
   maximum (0.054) in 2000s, which indicates that China's power system
   begins the coordinated development through a run-in. (3) The
   co-evolution of the power system is hindered by too much policy

Abstract = {{The importance of the interdependence between water and energy, also
   known as the water-energy nexus, is well recognized. The water-energy
   nexus is typically characterized in resource use efficiency terms such
   as energy intensity. This study aims to explore the quantitative results
   of the nexus in terms of energy intensity and environmental impacts
   (mainly greenhouse gas emissions) on existing water systems within urban
   water cycles. We also characterized the influence of water risks on the
   water-energy nexus, including baseline water stress (a water quantity
   indicator) and return flow ratio (a water quality indicator). For the 20
   regions and 4 countries surveyed (including regions with low to
   extremely high water risks that are geographically located in Africa,
   Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America), their energy intensities
   were positively related to the water risks. Regions with higher water
   risks were observed to have relatively higher energy and GHG intensities
   associated with their water supply systems. This mainly reflected the
   major influence of source water accessibility on the nexus, particularly
   for regions requiring energy-intensive imported or groundwater supplies,
   or desalination. Regions that use tertiary treatment (for water
   reclamation or environmental protection) for their wastewater treatment
   systems also had relatively higher energy and GHG emission intensities,
   but the intensities seemed to be independent from the water risks.
   On-site energy recovery (e.g., biogas or waste heat) in the wastewater
   treatment systems offered a great opportunity for reducing overall
   energy demand and its associated environmental impacts. Future policy
   making for the water and energy sectors should carefully consider the
   water energy nexus at the regional or local level to achieve maximum
   environmental and economic benefits. The results from this study can
   provide a better understanding of the water-energy nexus and informative
   recommendations for future policy directions for the effective
   management of water and energy.}},

Title = {{Grey forecasting method of quarterly hydropower production in China
   based on a data grouping approach}},
Journal = {{APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{302-316}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Grey model GM (1,1) has been widely used in short-term prediction of
   energy production and consumption due to its advantages in data sets
   with small numbers of samples. However, the existing GM (1,1) modelling
   method can merely forecast the general trend of a time series but fails
   to identify and predicts the seasonal fluctuations. In the research, the
   authors propose a data grouping approach based grey modelling method
   DGGM (1,1) to predict quarterly hydropower production in China. Firstly,
   the proposed method is used to divide an entire quarterly time series
   into four groups, each of which contains only time series data within
   the same quarter. Afterwards, by using the new series of four quarters,
   models are established, each of which includes specific seasonal
   characteristics. Finally, according to the chronological order, the
   prediction results of four GM (1,1) models are combined into a complete
   quarterly time series to reflect seasonal differences. The mean absolute
   percent errors (MAPEs) of the test set 2011Q1-2015Q4 solved using the
   DGGM (1,1), traditional GM (1,1), and SARIMA models are 16.2\%, 22.1\%,
   and 22.2\%, respectively; the results indicated that DGGM (1,1) has
   better adaptability and offers a higher prediction accuracy. It is
   predicted that China's hydropower production from 2016 to 2020 is
   supposed to maintain its seasonal growth with the third and first
   quarters showing the highest and lowest productions, respectively. (C)

Abstract = {{Chronological operation simulation (COS) is an essential tool for
   planning and analyzing power systems under high penetration of renewable
   energy. Conventional COS methods heavily depend on the availability of
   renewable power output data to obtain accurate results, and often
   require hours or even days of computational time while the sequential
   simulation could easily get infeasible for power systems with intensive
   flexibility. To cover the absence of output data for newly proposed wind
   and solar projects and accelerate the computation speed, this paper
   proposes a novel COS simulation framework for regional power systems
   with high penetration of renewable energies using meteorological data.
   The proposed simulation framework consists of the following three steps:
   data preparation, modeling and solving, and result output. In the data
   preparation step, wind, solar power output profiles and heat demands are
   converted from public accessible meteorological data. Then in the
   modeling and solving step, a unit commitment based COS model for
   simulating the hourly operation of power and heat sectors is proposed,
   and the proposed model is solved with a time domain partitioning (TDP)
   and a rollback mechanism to accelerate the computation speed as well as
   avoiding infeasible solutions. The accuracy of the wind and solar power
   output converted from meteorological data is verified through comparing
   with measured power output. Moreover, the feasibility and accuracy of
   utilizing the proposed COS framework to simulate the operation of a real
   regional power system is also verified through the 2015 annual operation
   statistics of the Northwest China Grid. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

   leading to a simple draining of the lake and inspection of the dam. The

   sociotechnical networks pro or against dam removal. This method aims to
   reconstruct the whole process of setting up the campaign groups and
   their trajectory and to understand the shaping of representations and

Abstract = {{Over the past two decades dam removal has emerged as a viable tool for
   ecological restoration of riverine landscapes, partially as a result of
   changing societal values toward the ecological trade-offs associated
   with dammed rivers. Dam condition, purpose and ownership are key factors
   that determine the legal and political processes that lead to dam
   removal in most cases. In the United States removals of small, privately
   owned dams are most common, although the most high-profile removals are
   associated with large hydropower dams subject to a federal relicensing
   process. Scholars cite this legal process for periodic re-evaluation of
   hydroelectric dams as an important window of opportunity for
   institutionalising adaptive environmental governance toward the
   renegotiation of social and ecological values associated with rivers. It
   is clear, however, that this policy process alone is not sufficient to
   facilitate large-scale dam removal and larger transitions toward
   adaptive governance. In this paper we review several high-profile cases
   of dam relicensing and removal in the Pacific Northwest region of the US
   to better understand the combination of factors that couple with dam
   relicensing policy to present a window of opportunity for adaptive
   governance and social-ecological restoration. Examples from the Pacific
   Northwest reveal patterns suggesting the critical role of endangered

Abstract = {{The United States is home to 2198 dams actively used for hydropower
   production. With the December 2015 consensus adoption of the United
   Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement, it is
   important to accurately quantify anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
   Methane ebullition, or methane bubbles originating from river or lake
   sediments, has been shown to account for nearly all methane emissions
   from tropical hydropower reservoirs to the atmosphere. However, distinct
   ebullitive methane fluxes have been studied in comparatively few
   temperate hydropower reservoirs globally. This study measures ebullitive
   and diffusive methane fluxes from two eastern Washington reservoirs, and
   synthesizes existing studies of methane ebullition in temperate, boreal,
   and tropical hydropower reservoirs. Ebullition comprises nearly all
   methane emissions (> 97\%) from this study's two eastern Washington
   hydropower reservoirs to the atmosphere. Summer methane ebullition from
   these reservoirs was higher than ebullition in six southeastern U.S.
   hydropower reservoirs, however it was similar to temperate reservoirs in
   other parts of the world. Our literature synthesis suggests that methane
   ebullition from temperate hydropower reservoirs can be seasonally
   elevated compared to tropical climates, however annual emissions are
   likely to be higher within tropical climates, emphasizing the possible
   range of methane ebullition fluxes and the need for the further study of
   temperate reservoirs. Possible future changes to the Intergovernmental

Abstract = {{This paper explores the viability of deep level gold mines in the Far
   West Rand (FWR) gold field, South Africa (SA), for underground pumped
   hydroelectric energy storage (UPHES). Ultra-deep, non-flooded shafts,
   extensive underground storage space, and abundance of water from an
   overlying karst aquifer make gold mines in the FWR exceptionally
   suitable for UPHES. With generating capacities ranging from 0.5 to over
   1.5 Gigawatts per plant, UPHESs are not only of potential significance
   to local gold mines suffering from frequent power cuts, but also for
   closing the peak load shortfall of the national grid as well as for
   storing surplus energy from the rapidly growing renewable energy sector.
   Furthermore, UPHES systems are able to avert large future expenditure
   for post closure mine water management by preventing the flooding of
   mine voids in an ecologically and economically sustainable manner.
   Moreover, UPHES provides two of the most critical elements for a
   successful post-closure development of former mining towns: energy and
   water. It protects scarce water resources in the semi-arid region and
   generates peak-demand electricity. Using an example of a gold mine
   located in the water-rich part of the FWR, this study found that UPHES
   is both, technically feasible and economically viable. It is strongly
   recommended to conduct a more detailed follow-up study as a base for
   establishing the world's first reference plant in SA.}},

   step of excavation, which is beyond the average deformation of completed
   underground main powerhouse caverns under similar scale and in-situ
   stress conditions in China. The field investigations, monitoring data
   and numerical simulations indicate that high second principal stress
   with a direction sub-vertical to the axis of the main powerhouse has a
   remarkable effect on the deformation and failure of the underground
   powerhouse. The failure types along the depth of the high sidewall at
   the main powerhouse can be identified as peeling off at the surface and
   slabbing and spalling at the near surface and deeper tension fracture
   failure. The failure at the high sidewall of the main powerhouse has
   obvious time effects. Expanding the deep fractures, tension and sliding
   of weak structural planes is highly correlated with the increase of the
   deformations, and the high second principal stress leads to an increase
   of the dynamic unloading effects and unloading relaxation degree, which
   lead to a higher occurrence of crack expansion and deep fractures.
   Meanwhile, the relatively high second principal stress exacerbated the
   stress concentration at the upstream spandrel and downstream arch foot
   of the main powerhouse and led to serious ballooning and cracking of the
   shotcrete layer and split failure of the surrounding rock mass.}},

Abstract = {{A new global estimate of surface turbulent fluxes, latent heat flux (LE)
   and sensible heat flux (H), and gross primary production (GPP) is
   developed using a machine learning approach informed by novel remotely
   sensed solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) and other radiative and
   meteorological variables. This is the first study to jointly retrieve
   LE, H, and GPP using SIF observations. The approach uses an artificial
   neural network (ANN) with a target dataset generated from three
   independent data sources, weighted based on a triple collocation (TC)
   algorithm. The new retrieval, named Water, Energy, and Carbon with
   Artificial Neural Networks (WECANN), provides estimates of LE, H, and
   GPP from 2007 to 2015 at 1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial resolution and at
   monthly time resolution. The quality of ANN training is assessed using
   the target data, and the WECANN retrievals are evaluated using eddy
   covariance tower estimates from the FLUXNET network across various
   climates and conditions. When compared to eddy covariance estimates,
   WECANN typically outperforms other products, particularly for sensible
   and latent heat fluxes. Analyzing WECANN retrievals across three extreme
   drought and heat wave events demonstrates the capability of the
   retrievals to capture the extent of these events. Uncertainty estimates
   of the retrievals are analyzed and the interannual variability in
   average global and regional fluxes shows the impact of distinct climatic
   events - such as the 2015 El Nino - on surface turbulent fluxes and GPP.}},

Abstract = {{Hydropower plays a major role in the Chinese electricity generation
   industry. It is of significant importance to perform efficiency
   evaluation of the economic operation in a power station, which can help
   promote better water resources management and create more benefits for
   power network. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to establish a
   set of evaluation indexes and investigate the evaluation method to
   assess the economic operation in a power station. Based on the operation
   chart, three evaluation indexes including the Relative Water Consumption
   Rate (RC), the Relative Hydropower Utilization Rate (RU), and the
   Relative Hydropower Utilization Increasing Rate (RI) were proposed. The
   Longyangxia power station, as the biggest peak regulation source in the
   Northwest Power Network in China and the largest reservoir in the Yellow
   River Basin, was selected to perform an efficiency evaluation of
   economic operation. The result showed that the economic operation of
   this power station was not reasonable with RC > 1, RU < 1 and RI < 0.
   And the rationality of the evaluation result was illustrated through
   analyzing the actual operation situation of the Longyangxia reservoir.

Abstract = {{With the rapid growth of energy demand, environmental and energy
   security issues have gain more and more attention recently. Distributed
   generation (DG), as one of the innovation energy power modes, has been
   rapidly developing in recent years. Thus, accurate prediction of
   distributed power load is significant for the balance of power supply
   and demand. This paper presents an intelligent model with a focus on the
   prediction of distributed power generation and the analysis of regional
   power supply structure. First, support vector machine is implemented to
   predict the utilization coefficient of DG, with fruit fly and immune
   algorithm (FOA-IA) optimizing its parameters. In addition, combined with
   the power capacity, the generating capacity of DG can be calculated.
   Then, in order to analyze the load reduction effect of regional power
   with DG, a novel stage combination forecasting model with neural network
   and polynomial regression is adopted to forecast power supply of the
   main grid. It can effectively solve the defect of nonconvergence of
   neural network and improve the prediction accuracy. Finally, based on
   the load forecasting results of both DG and main grid, the peak clipping
   effect of DG on power grid load has been carried. A certain regional
   power grid with distributed wind power generation in China is taken as
   case study to verify the practicability and effectiveness of the
   proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed model has the
   characteristics of high accuracy and strong generalization.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its advantages over other energy sources, hydropower facilities
   are recognized as causes of terrestrial and freshwater environmental
   impacts. A deeper understanding of hydropower effects on surrounding
   riparian forests is thus important to the development hydropower
   facilities of less impact on the environment as well as to define
   criteria to manage the vegetation in the vicinity of large hydroelectric
   dams. We compared tree community structure on forest slopes exposed to a
   hydropower reservoir created in 2005 with control ones, in the
   biodiversity-rich subtropical forests of southern Brazil. Field data
   were collected between 2009 and 2011 on six forest slopes of which three
   were affected by the rise in water level caused by a hydropower dam,
   while the other three were in nearby sites unaffected by damming. Ninety
   10 x 10 plots were set along six 50 m x 10 m transects. Forest structure
   was significantly affected by vicinity of reservoir, but this effect
   differed significantly between different tributaries of the Pelotas
   River. Rarefaction curves showed homogeneity in species richness among
   the studied hills. Composition differed significantly between reservoir
   and control areas. Variance partition results showed that pure reservoir
   effects explained a fraction of the variance in floristic composition
   comparable to environmental factors. Vicinity to reservoir was the main
   factor able to distinguish between communities in the studied system in
   a multiple regression tree. Our results highlight that hydroelectric
   facility building produces more extensive damage to remnant native

Abstract = {{The upper Yangtze River region is one of the most frequent debris flow
   areas in China. The study area contains a cascade of six large
   hydropower stations located along the river with total capacity of more

   potential and dynamic differences in debris flow susceptibility and
   intensity with regard to seasonal monsoon events. We analyzed this
   region's debris flow history by examining the effective peak
   acceleration of antecedent earthquakes, the impacts of antecedent
   droughts, the combined effects of earthquakes and droughts, with regard
   to topography, precipitation, and loose solid material conditions. Based
   on these factors, we developed a debris flow susceptibility map. Results
   indicate that the entire debris flow susceptibility area is 167,500
   km(2), of which 26,800 km(2) falls within the high susceptibility area,
   with 60,900 km(2) in medium and 79,800 km(2) are in low susceptibility
   areas. Three of the six large hydropower stations are located within the
   areas with high risk of debris flows. The synthetic zonation map of
   debris flow susceptibility for the study area corresponds with both the

Abstract = {{Steel production is a main water consumer, energy consumer, and a major
   source of air pollution in China. To mitigate the steel industry's
   environmental pressures, the government is promoting several
   water-saving, energy saving, and emission-reduction technologies. This
   study developed a technology-based approach to investigate the water,
   energy and emission nexus (WEEN) of the steel industry. The results
   indicate that 4.1 m(3) of water use and 21.4 kWh of electricity use were
   related with the WEEN per ton of crude steel production in 2014, which
   accounted for around 66\% of the total water use and 7\% of electricity
   consumption of steel production, respectively. Of the WEEN water
   consumption, 66\% and 34\% was for cooling and emission control,
   respectively; 96\% of the WEEN electricity consumption was for emission
   control. The water-energy-SO2 nexus was more intensive in the coking and
   sintering processes, whereas the water-energy-dust nexus was more
   intensive in the steel-making process. Diffusion of advanced technology
   and improved raw material quality can reduce existing SO2 and NOx
   emissions by 57\% and 25\%, although at the expense of 5\%, 56\%, 0.2\%,
   and 40\% increases of dust emissions, water consumption, energy
   consumption, and costs, respectively. Technology sets identified by the
   Pareto optimization method can reduce the SO2, NOx and dust emissions by
   97\%, 50\%, and 75\%, respectively, and water and energy consumption can
   be reduced by 10\% and 2\%, respectively; however, costs could increase

Abstract = {{Residential water use accounts for at least 80\% of water-related energy
   (WRE) demand (primarily through water heating) in the residential urban
   water system. Cold water temperature (CWT) is a key determinant in
   predicting residential WRE but variation of CWT within water networks
   has not been quantified and is not accounted for in water heating energy
   consumption guidelines. Here, we analysed the spatiotemporal variability
   in CWT over the course of a year (2013) using 5760 measurements from
   1255 urban water system sampling locations across the Yarra Valley Water
   region in Melbourne, Australia. CWT varied across the study site from
   12-28 degrees C during summer and 9-15 degrees C during winter. Spatial
   clusters of higher CWT regions (hot spots) and lower CWT regions (cold
   spots) were also observed. The CWT variability impact on annual
   household WRE demand was estimated to be between 17 to +19\% (-640 to
   +680 kWh/hh.yr) change in water heating for sample households, which is
   dependent on the geographical location of the household within the study
   site. However, households located in cold spot regions will have almost
   twice the amount of WRE demand than average, conversely, WRE demand will
   be lower than average in hot spot regions.
   Monthly mean CWTs diverged from the Australian Standards for hot water
   system energy consumption guidelines value by 21 to +47\%. The magnitude
   of CWT variability and associated energy required for water heating are
   comparable with the total energy used by water utilities to deliver
   water supply and sewage disposal services. Variation in water heating
   could be as large as -4.6 kWh/hh.d (hot spot in March) and 3.6 kWh/hh.d
   (cold spot in July), more than three times the total energy used to
   deliver water supply and sewage disposal services for this region.
   Accounting for CWT variability could increase accuracy of regional-scale

Abstract = {{Wind and hydropower together constitute nearly 80\% of the renewable

   Oscillation - canonical and Modoki - on the wind and hydro resources.
   Also, the Modoki El Ni-similar to no and the Modoki La Ni-similar to na

Abstract = {{Small-scale hydropower is a robust and reliable form of sustainable
   energy supply in remote areas. On the one hand, the potential for
   hydropower generation depends on the specific climate in a given place,
   and precipitation above all. On the other hand, such potential also
   depends on the catchment's characteristics, e.g., topography, land use,
   and soils. In the absence of discharge measurements, the available river
   flow for hydropower production can be estimated in the form of a flow
   duration curve based on these variables. In this study, the lumped
   rainfall-runoff method by Crawford and Thurin (1981) was modified to
   calculate a flow duration curve with a daily time step for an ungauged
   catchment in Nicaragua. Satisfactory results could be obtained by
   calibrating the method with the aid of a few discharge measurements.
   Best results were obtained with a parameter set for groundwater flow and
   recharge to groundwater from excess soil moisture of 0.014 and 0.6,
   respectively. Considering the climate and catchment characteristics of
   the study site, this parameterization can be physically reasoned.}},

   AC/DC Power System with a Large Amount of Renewable Energy}},

Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{A conventional steady-state power flow security check only implements
   point-by-point assessment, which cannot provide a security margin for
   system operation. The concept of a steady-state security region is
   proposed to effectively tackle this problem. Considering that the
   commissioning of the increasing number of HVDC (High Voltage Direct
   Current) and the fluctuation of renewable energy have significantly
   affected the operation and control of a conventional AC system, the
   definition of the steady-state security region of the AC/DC power system
   is proposed in this paper based on the AC/DC power flow calculation
   model including LCC/VSC (Line Commutated Converter/Voltage Sourced
   Converter)-HVDC transmission and various AC/DC constraints, and hence
   the application of the security region is extended. In order to ensure
   that the proposed security region can accurately provide global security
   information of the power system under the fluctuations of renewable
   energy, this paper presents four methods (i.e., a screening method of
   effective boundary surfaces, a fitting method of boundary surfaces, a
   safety judging method, and a calculation method of distances and
   corrected distance between the steady-state operating point and the
   effective boundary surfaces) based on the relation analysis between the
   steady-state security region geometry and constraints. Also, the
   physical meaning and probability analysis of the corrected distance are
   presented. Finally, a case study is demonstrated to test the feasibility
   of the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{Electric power transmission lines in service in southwest China have
   fallen far behind the power sources. With rapid development of
   hydropower in this area, severe water spills for hydropower frequently
   occur during the flood season because of limited transmission capacity.
   Effective coordinated operation among large and small hydropower plants
   (LHPPs and SHPPs) in the area is a feasible approach for alleviating
   this problem. Using the Yunnan Power Grid (YNPG) of southwest China as
   an example, a long-term coordinated optimal operation model (COOM) for
   an integrated system of LHPPs and SHPPs is proposed in this paper. Total
   electricity that can be consumed or transmitted is defined as
   electricity absorption. Maximizing the total electricity absorption,
   which implies balancing high average water heads with reservoir spills,
   was selected as the objective. Satisfying multiple voltage transmission
   constraints is a critical issue. A progressive optimality algorithm
   (POA) was used to solve the model based on a multidimensional search in
   two-stage optimizations. Results from the YNPG case study show that the
   proposed method can achieve greater total electricity absorption while
   effectively reducing spillage. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Movement and habitat utilization of juvenile Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser
   fulvescens) were examined in Stephens Lake, a large hydroelectric
   reservoir on the Nelson River, Manitoba, Canada, between 21 June 2011,
   and 15 October 2012. Stephens Lake is defined by a sharp hydraulic
   gradient at the upstream end (Gull Rapids) and a pronounced reservoir
   transition zone (RTZ), characterized by a change in substrate
   composition from coarse to fine. Twenty juvenile Lake Sturgeon <600mm
   fork length were captured in the RTZ, implanted with acoustic
   transmitters, and tracked using stationary receivers. Our primary
   hypothesis considered that, if foraging behaviour was contingent on sand
   substrate, these fish would spend the majority of the open-water season
   foraging in the relatively small area where hydraulic gradients dictate
   sand deposition. Data indicated that tracked individuals were highly
   bottom oriented, and utilized deeper thalweg habitats exclusively during
   the first open-water season. On average, juveniles spent only 22\% of
   their open-water time in the RTZ (river kilometer {[}rkm] 4.5-7.0). Most
   fish spent more time upstream as opposed to downstream, but a few
   individuals did utilize backwatered thalweg areas, suggesting that
   silt-overlay habitats may be suitable for foraging. A seasonal spatial
   shift in distribution was also observed. Juveniles vacated the RTZ as
   winter progressed, moving further downstream and occasionally laterally
   into backwatered shallows, potentially avoiding extreme ice conditions
   and a large hanging ice dam that develops downstream of Gull Rapids.
   After ice break-up, most individuals with active tags returned to the
   upstream end of Stephens Lake. The results add to the growing body of
   evidence that suggests factors other than habitat suitability influence
   Lake Sturgeon movement and utilization patterns, raising questions about
   the mechanisms for core-area affinity in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Europe has a large tradition of Small Hydropower stations (SHP); these
   proliferate wherever there was an adequate supply of moving water and a
   need for electricity. As electricity demand grew many of these plants
   were abandoned. Today with the rising price of energy, SHP can be a
   solution to help rural electrification, furthermore SHPs do not consume
   the water that drives the turbines. The advantage of this technology is
   extremely robust and systems can last for 50 years or more with little
   maintenance. This paper summarizes an overview of SHP Hydropower in
   Europe. Hydropower on a small scale, or micro-hydro, is one of the most
   cost effective energy technologies to be considered for rural
   electrification in less developed countries. Europe is a market leader
   of SHP technology. Optimal turbine designs are available and new
   technical developments offer automated operation of SHP. The present
   role of SHP in Europe in the development of renewable energy sources is
   discussed through this paper. The main producers of SHP electricity in
   Europe are Italy, France, Spain, Germany and Sweden. On the other hand,
   10 European countries are ranked based on the total numbers of SHPs:
   Germany (7,512), Italy (2,427), France (1,935), Sweden (1,901), Spain
   (1,047), Poland (722), Romania (274), Portugal (155) and UK (120). The
   research shows that there is a considerable scope for development and
   optimization of this technology. This opens new perspectives because it
   has a huge, as yet untapped potential in most areas of Europe and can
   make a significant contribution to future energy needs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a risk explicit interval two-stage programming (REITSP)
   model was proposed for supporting the regional electricity generation

   effectively tackle multiple uncertainties expressed as interval numbers.
   But unlike the traditional interval two-stage programming model, the
   proposed REITSP model could provide an explicit trade-off information
   between system cost and risk for decision makers with different risk
   preferences. It could minimize the total system cost, as well as the
   decision risk according to the aspiration risk level of decision maker.
   The developed REITSP model was applied to the case study in Guangdong
   Province, China for its long-term electricity system planning. Crisp
   solutions under different aspiration risk levels for varying RPS targets
   were obtained and analyzed. The results showed that according to the
   current available renewable energy and affordable construction speed,
   the maximum RPS target for Guangzhou Province during 2016-2025 should be
   17\%. Higher RPS level would promote the renewable energy generation,
   especially solar power; meanwhile, it would reduce the CO2 emission and
   the imported electricity, but with greater investment cost. The obtained

   show that the inclusion of these features can have a non-trivial effect
   on the simulated response of hydropower production to changes in
   climate. Simulation results highlight substantial uncertainty in the
   direction of change in globally aggregated hydropower production

Abstract = {{Fossil energy and water resources are both important for economic and
   social development in China, and they are tightly interlinked. Fossil
   energy production consumes large amounts of water, and it is essential
   to investigate the water footprint of fossil energy production (WFEP) in
   China. In addition, fossil energy is supplied to consumers in China by
   both domestic and foreign producers, and understanding the water
   footprint of fossil energy supply (WFES) is also highly significant for
   water and energy development programs in the long-term. The objectives
   of this paper were to provide an estimation of the blue component of
   WFEP and WFES in China for the period from 2001 to 2014, and to evaluate
   the impact on water resources from energy production, the contribution
   of internal and external WFES, and water-energy related issues of the
   international energy trade by applying water footprint analysis based on
   the bottom-up approach. The results indicate that generally, the WFEP
   and WFES in China both maintained steady growth before 2013, with the
   WFEP increasing from approximately 3900 million m(3)/year to 10,400
   million m(3)/year, while the WFES grew from 3900 million m(3)/year to
   11,600 million m3/year. The fossil energy production caps of the 13th
   Five Year Plan can bring the water consumed for fossil energy production
   back to a sustainable level. Over the long-term, China's energy trade

Abstract = {{Hydrologic changes caused by diversion hydropower are poorly described.
   Herein, we evaluate hydrologic alteration in 32 ungauged rivers
   developed for diversion hydropower. We simulated long-term unregulated
   discharge records before perturbing flows with the hydropower diversion
   and comparing periods with and without diversion. We detected
   statistically significant changes to flow regime metrics across all
   rivers. Magnitudes across a range of flows consistently decreased
   following diversion, flow variability decreased substantially, and
   transitions between flows of different magnitudes became more abrupt.
   Magnitudes of 7-day minimum flows were lower by a mean of 41 +/- 23\% (p
   < .05 for 19 rivers), annual maximum flows decreased significantly (p <
   .05) in 22 rivers, and 7-day maximum flows decreased by a mean of 52 +/-
   18\% (p < .05 for 26 rivers). Temporally dynamic low to moderate flows
   were replaced by static minimal flows, leading to a mean 184 +/- 49\%
   increase in flow constancy. Mean duration of events sustained below the
   prediversion Q(75) increased (p < .05 for 32 rivers) from a mean of 3
   days to a mean of 27 days after diversion. Mean hydrograph rise and fall
   rates doubled and tripled, respectively (p < .05 for 28 rivers). We
   detected few changes to peak flow timing. Although direction of observed
   change was consistent among the rivers, magnitudes and significance of
   response often varied between rivers. A proposed diversion index largely
   explained response variability among the 32 rivers. Results highlight
   that hydropower systems without storage reservoirs can profoundly affect
   river flow regimes when water is diverted from the river.}},

Abstract = {{Dagangshan hydropower station is located in the middle of Dadu River,
   Southwest China. Many diabase dikes were exposed in the adamellite
   granite body during excavation of the underground caverns. The dikes are
   highly directional, have crushed interiors, exhibit strong alteration,
   and have poor contact relationships with surrounding rocks, all of which
   is inconsistent with the characteristics of typical diabase. This paper
   describes systematic research that focused on the dikes' spatial
   distribution, macroscopic characteristics, physical and mechanical
   properties, and common instability modes. Factors influencing their
   stability and their corresponding control measurements are discussed in
   the context of the site and its conditions. Results show that most of
   the dikes located in the underground caverns are the branches of the
   main dike beta 9, which produced from a strong basic magma
   extrusion-overflow event happened in between the Permian and Triassic.
   Due to multiple strong tectonic activities, the chlorite alignment of
   these dikes generally tended to be significant and leaded the physical
   and mechanical properties to be poor. Then, excavation and repetitive
   blasts resulted in strong disturbances to the original dikes and even
   caused rock unloading (collapse, rock block fall) and groundwater runoff
   system (water inflow) change. According to the common instability modes
   and reasons of diabase dikes, some specific control measures including
   solidified rubbles, reinforcement methods, pre-grouting, and small ducts
   are implemented in order to keep the surrounding of diabase safety, and

Abstract = {{In this study, a multi-reservoir based water-hydroenergy management
   (MWH) model is developed for planning water allocation and hydroenergy
   generation (WAHG) under uncertainties. A mixed fuzzy-stochastic risk
   analysis method (MFSR) is introduced to handle objective and subjective
   uncertainties in MWH model, which can couple fuzzy credibility
   programming and risk management within a general two-stage context, with
   aim to reflect the infeasibility risks between expected targets and
   random second-stage recourse costs. The developed MWH model (embedded by
   MFSR method) can be applied to a practical study of WAHG issue in Jing
   River Basin (China), which encounters conflicts between human activity
   and resource/energy crisis. The construction of water-energy nexus (WEN)
   is built to reflect integrity of economic development and
   resource/energy conservation, as well as confronting natural and
   artificial damages such as water deficit, electricity insufficient,
   floodwater, high sedimentation deposition contemporarily. Meanwhile, the
   obtained results with various credibility levels and target-violated
   risk levels can support generating a robust plan associated with risk
   control for identification of the optimized water-allocation and
   hydroenergy-generation alternatives, as well as flood controls.
   Moreover, results can be beneficial for policymakers to discern the
   optimal water/sediment release routes, reservoirs' storage variations
   (impacted by sediment deposition), electricity supply schedules and
   system benefit plans with an effective/sustainable manner. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Nutrients and water found in domestic treated wastewater are valuable
   and can be reutilized in urban agriculture as a potential strategy to
   provide communities with access to fresh produce. In this paper, this
   proposition is examined by conducting a field study in the rapidly
   developing city of Hyderabad, India. Urban agriculture trade-offs in
   water use, energy use and GHG emissions, nutrient uptake, and crop
   pathogen quality are evaluated, and irrigation waters of varying
   qualities (treated wastewater, versus untreated water and groundwater)
   are compared. The results are counter-intuitive, and illustrate
   potential synergies and key constraints relating to the
   food-energy-water-health (FEW-health) nexus in developing cities. First,
   when the impact of GHG emissions from untreated wastewater diluted in
   surface streams is compared with the life cycle assessment of wastewater
   treatment with reuse in agriculture, the treatment-plus-reuse case
   yields a 33\% reduction in life cycle system-wide GHG emissions. Second,
   despite water cycling benefits in urban agriculture, only < 1\% of the
   nutrients are able to be captured in urban agriculture, limited by the
   small proportion of effluent divertible to urban agriculture due to land
   constraints. Thus, water treatment plus reuse in urban farms can enhance
   GHG mitigation and also directly save groundwater; however, very large
   amounts of land are needed to extract nutrients from dilute effluents.
   Third, although energy use for wastewater treatment results in pathogen
   indicator organism concentrations in irrigation water to be reduced by
   99.9\% (three orders of magnitude) compared to the untreated case, crop
   pathogen content was reduced by much less, largely due to environmental
   contamination and farmer behavior and harvesting practices. The study
   uncovers key physical, environmental, and behavioral factors that
   constrain benefits achievable at the FEW-health nexus in urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{In some cases such as the power grid in eastern China, a regional power

Abstract = {{Climate change, population growth and rapidly increasing urbanisation
   severely threaten water quantity and quality in Sub-Saharan Africa.
   Treating wastewater is necessary to preserve the water bodies; reusing
   treated wastewater appears a viable option that could help to address
   future water challenges. In areas already suffering energy poverty, the
   main barrier to wastewater treatment is the high electricity demand of
   most facilities. This work aims to assess the benefits of integrating
   renewable energy technologies to satisfy the energy needs of a
   wastewater treatment facility based on a conventional activated sludge
   system, and also considers the case of including a membrane bioreactor
   so treated wastewater can be reused for irrigation. Using HOMER, a
   software tool specifically developed for optimal analysis of hybrid
   micro-generation systems, we identify the optimal combination of
   renewable energy technologies for these facilities when located in a
   specific water-stressed area of Sub-Saharan Africa and assess whether
   the solutions are cost-effective. The analysis shows investment in
   renewable technologies is cost-effective when the true cost of
   electricity or average days of power outages per year are considered.
   Integration of photovoltaic panels, a wind turbine and internal
   combustion engine fuelled by biogas produced by anaerobic digestion can
   cover between 33\% and 55\% of the electricity demand of the basic
   wastewater facility, at a levelised cost of energy lower than the true
   cost of electricity. In the case of water reuse, the techno-economically
   viable solutions identified by HOMER can cover 13\% of energy needs.
   Finally, we discuss how the proposed solutions could provide a large
   contribution to socio-political security, in both domestic and
   cross-border contexts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Meeting the growing water and food demands in a densely populated
   country like India is a major challenge. It requires an extensive
   investigation into the changing patterns of the checks and balances
   behind the maintenance of food security at the expense of depleting
   groundwater, along with high energy consumption. Here we present a
   comprehensive set of analyses which assess the present status of the
   water-food-energy nexus in India, along with its changing pattern, in
   the last few decades. We find that with the growth of population and
   consequent increase in the food demands, the food production has also
   increased, and this has been made possible with the intensification of
   irrigation. However, during the recent decade (after 1996), the increase
   in food production has not been sufficient to meet its growing demands,
   precipitating a decline in the per-capita food availability. We also
   find a statistically significant declining trend of groundwater storage
   in India during the last decade, as derived from the Gravity Recovery
   and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite datasets. Regional studies
   reveal contrasting trends between northern and western-central India.
   North-western India and the middle Ganga basin show a decrease in the
   groundwater storage as opposed to an increasing storage over
   western-central India. Comparison with well data reveals that the
   highest consistency of GRACE-derived storage data with available well
   measurements is in the middle Ganga basin. After analysing the data for
   the last 2 decades, we further showcase that, after a drought, the
   groundwater storage drops but is unable to recover to its original
   condition even after good monsoon years. The groundwater storage reveals
   a very strong negative correlation with the electricity consumption for
   agricultural usage, which may also be considered as a proxy for
   groundwater pumped for irrigation in a region. The electricity usage for
   agricultural purposes has an increasing trend and, interestingly, it
   does not have any correlation with the monsoon rainfall as computed with
   the original or de-trended variables. This reveals an important finding
   that the irrigation has been intensified irrespective of rainfall. This
   also resulted in a decreasing correlation between the food production
   and monsoon rainfall, revealing the increasing dependency of
   agricultural activities on irrigation. We conclude that irrigation has
   now become essential for agriculture to meet the food demand; however,
   it should be judiciously regulated and controlled, based on the water
   availability from monsoon rainfall, specifically after the drought
   years, as it is essential to recover from the deficits suffered
   previously.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an environmental assessment of a bi-fuel Thermal
   Power Plant (TPP) in the Brazilian Amazon Region. The TPP was originally
   designed to use Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), but with the Natural Gas (NG)
   extraction in the Amazon basin, the TPP was modified to use NG and HFO
   concomitantly. In order to observe the differences, a comparative study
   of this power plant was performed in two situations: using only heavy
   fuel oil and using HFO and NG concomitantly. The life cycle assessment
   methodology was conducted from ``cradle-to-gate{''}. The CML baseline
   method was used to assess the midpoint impacts. Primary data were
   collected by personal visits for environmental emissions, wastewater,
   fuel used, and technical specifications. Eleven impact categories were
   considered and Monte Carlo (MC) Analysis was used to assess and to
   obtain robust results. The study shows that upstream processes have more
   impacts except global warming potential, eutrophication, acidification,
   human toxicity and photochemical oxidation where TPP showed the main
   contribution. The bi-fuel conversion resulted in lower power plant
   participations in the impacts as, for example, a reduction of 61.1\% in
   Eutrophication Potential. In addition, throughout the life cycle the
   bi-fuel power plant, when the operation is compared with HFO only, has
   six potential impacts lower. Furthermore, this study showed that bi-fuel
   operation has lower local and regional impact, and according to the MC
   analysis, statistically, bi-fuel operation does not contribute to
   exacerbate global trends in GHG emissions when compared with monofuel
   operation. It is an interesting observation that global warming results
   by MC analysis showed that there are no statistical differences between
   the two modes of operation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There are still residents without access to electricity in some remote
   and less developed areas of China, which lead to low living standards
   and hinder sustainable development for these residents. In order to
   achieve the strategic targets of solving China's energy poverty,
   realizing basic energy service equalization, and comprehensively
   building up a moderately prosperous society, several policies have been
   successively promulgated in recent years, which aim to solve the
   electricity access issue for residents living in remote and less
   developed areas. It is of great importance to determine the most
   economical mode of power supply in remote and less developed areas,
   which directly affects the economic efficiency of public investment
   projects. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to select the most
   economical power supply mode for rural electrification in China.
   Firstly, the primary modes to supply electricity for residents living in
   the remote and less developed areas are discussed, which include power
   grid extension mode and micro-grid mode. Secondly, based on the
   levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) technique, the life cycle economic
   cost accounting model for different power supply modes are built.
   Finally, taking a minority nationality village in Yunnan province as an
   example, the empirical analysis is performed, and the LCOEs of various
   possible modes for rural electrification are accounted. The results show
   that the photovoltaic (PV)-based independent micro-grid system is the
   most economical due to the minimum LCOE, namely 0.658 RMB/kWh. However,
   other power supply modes have much higher LCOEs. The LCOEs of power grid
   extension model, wind-based independent micro-grid system and
   biomass-based independent micro-grid system are 1.078 RMB/kWh, 0.704
   RMB/kWh and 0.885 RMB/kWh, respectively. The proposed approach is
   effective and practical, which can provide reference for rural
   electrification in China.}},

   energy conversion efficiency based on field investigations was merely
   1.28 kg (kWh)(-1), which was only 64\% of the empirical value and 54\%
   of the guideline for accounting for the ecological benefit of small

   but no substituting fuel or households with no hydropower plant. (3)
   Most of the households had a positive attitude towards SHSF because of
   its cheaper electricity and associated ecological environmental

Abstract = {{The main focus of this paper is to select an economically suitable
   sustainable standalone power supply system for a remote off-grid town in
   Western Australia. Existing power systems of such remote towns in
   Australia have adverse environmental impacts and contribute to global
   warming due to the utilization of fossil fuels, especially diesel and
   gas. The possible electricity supply systems for such towns can vary
   from a diesel/gas generator towards a hybrid system composed of a
   generator, Wind turbine, photovoltaic system, and battery energy
   storage. In order to limit the cost of the system and to propose the
   most economically feasible solution, various combinations of supply
   systems are considered. These systems are analyzed in this paper by the
   help of HOMER software to determine the optimal architecture and the
   control strategy of the supply system. This study has used real demand
   data of the town, as well as the prices of different electrical
   components in the Australian market. The scenario which yields the
   minimum cost of energy is defined and suggested. Also, a decision-making
   based technique is proposed to help the local electricity utility in
   finding the suitable solution in the case of budget limits on the
   investment and annual operation and maintenance. Another aim of this
   analysis is to investigate and illustrate the impact of a small annual
   load growth on the size of the selected components for the selected
   power system, as well as the total net present cost and the cost of
   electricity. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to analyze the
   impact of uncertainties of some of the parameters in the outcome of the
   study to obtain the optimized cost of the selected system. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas have been used as
   the major sources of energy in the recent past. However, the negative
   environmental impacts associated with the emission of the greenhouse
   gases from these, conventional energy sources forced to realize the
   importance of renewable energy resources. At the same time, the average
   annual exponential rate of population growth in India needs increasing
   amounts of freshwater for the basic necessities. This might result in
   water scarcity as the overall population in India is expected to
   increase to 1.60 billion by 2050. It has been forecasted that, by the
   year 2040, India will rank 40th in the world in terms of water scarcity.
   To meet the rising fresh-water demand, desalination is an intelligent
   and sustainable option for India, which has a very long coastline
   measuring 7517 km. In this paper, an attempt has been made to provide a
   comprehensive review of water scarcity in India and suggest a possible
   solution, which is implementing desalination technologies coupled with
   renewable resources. The paper reviews the ground water scenario in
   India and the global desalination market. We summarize the energy
   consumption in various desalination processes and provide a brief
   outlook of the desalination techniques in India. Apart from this,
   desalination using non-conventional sources such as solar, wind, and
   geothermal energy is discussed. In addition, factors affecting the
   environment due to desalination and the potential counter measures are
   presented. This review aims to provide an awareness of the projected
   water crisis in India, in the coming decades, and is also aimed to help
   the policy makers for selecting an appropriate desalination technology.}},

Abstract = {{Water, energy, and food (WEF) have complex interconnections. Water is
   required to produce energy, while energy is needed for water extraction,
   treatment, and distribution. The food sector requires water and energy
   to produce food products, while fertilizer and pesticide from farmland
   have a negative impact on water quality; however, biomass is a potential
   alternative energy source. Understanding these interconnections will
   help determine the developmental framework that connects all of the
   elements. Some global regions have implemented a variety of sustainable
   management concepts to manage the natural resources, however, mainly for
   an individual resource. Furthermore, various computer models have been
   developed to estimate the interdependency of each resource and to
   quantify future requirements of WEF; the limitations of current models
   have opened opportunities for development through the addition of
   components and features such as feedback analysis, optimization, and
   visualization. We reviewed the literature to determine the present state
   of the WEF nexus, especially its global implementation and simulation

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to characterize the water footprint of the
   Tucuruf and Lajeado hydropower plants (HPPs), located in the Tocantins
   River Basin, Brazil. The water footprint of hydropower was evaluated by
   three different methods based on the electricity production of the HPP
   and the monthly and annual evaporation rates estimated according to
   Penman's method. The first water footprint method (WF-1) considers only
   the gross water consumption by the HPPs; the second method (WF-2)
   considers the net water consumption, discounting what would be lost by
   evapotranspiration in the area previous to the construction of the
   reservoir; and the third method (WF-3) accounts for the net water
   balance. The results demonstrated that the estimates of average annual
   water footprint for the Tucuruf reservoir, using the WF-1, WF-2 and WF-3
   methods, were, respectively, 49 m(3)/GJ, 26 m(3)/GJ and 21 m(3)/GI,
   while for Lajeado, these estimates were 95 m(3)/GI, 48 m(3)/GJ and 21
   m(3)/GJ. The flooded area of the reservoir per unit of installed
   capacity of Tucuruf HPP is 34 ha/MW, while for Lajeado, this value
   reaches 70 ha/MW, which explains Tucurui's greater water efficiency.
   Confirming this result, the normalized WFs based on the reservoir area
   and the installed capacity were approximately 100\% higher for the
   Lajeado HPP than for the Tucuruf HPP through all water footprint methods
   analyzed. The WF-2 method is the most appropriate to account for the
   consumption of water directly related to hydroelectric energy generation
   since it considers the change in evaporation caused by the construction
   of the reservoir. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{195}},
Pages = {{36-51}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Short-term electricity markets are generally defined as markets that
   take place from the day-ahead stage until physical generation and
   consumption. These markets include day-ahead, intra-day, and real-time
   balancing markets. In Europe, the first two are managed by power
   exchanges, while the third consists of reserve procurement and imbalance
   settlement and is operated by the local transmission system operator.
   Short-term markets are important tools to deal with net demand
   variability in the system, in which the need for flexibility is
   expressed and its provision is valorized. Due to the ongoing integration
   of variable renewables in the generation mix, the system's variability
   is increasing as a result of the limited controllability and
   predictability of those resources. As such, these markets become
   increasingly important. The contribution of this article is a
   comprehensive up-to-date discussion of the key design parameters and
   functioning of all three short-term markets, and their impact on the
   demand for and supply of flexibility. An understanding of the design and
   its implications is useful to policy-makers who are considering changes
   to facilitate the integration, availability, or valorization of
   flexibility, while also contributing to the decision-making of
   flexibility investors and operators. The geographical scope is the
   Central Western European region, including the Belgian, French, German,
   and Dutch market zones. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A crucial aspect of the energy and water nexus is reflected with the
   revelation of the surprisingly high amount of industrial water use
   induced by plant infrastructure of a pilot solar power generation system
   in China, by means of a concrete hybrid of process analysis and
   Input-Output analysis. With an inclusive collection of all the input
   items as products of the economy, this scoping distinguishes from
   existing accountings that either overlook the construction stage or
   simply cover the plant infrastructure of solar power system as some
   primary materials. Supported by embodied water database from
   input-output analysis, the industrial water use induced by each input
   item is fully addressed. The industrial water use induced by the solar
   power plant infrastructure is revealed to be over one order of magnitude
   higher than that in previous scoping: this magnitude approximately
   doubles the life cycle industrial freshwater withdrawal of typical
   coal-fired power generation system for per unit amount of electricity
   generated. Under the 2020 scenario raised in the newly issued 13th Five
   Year Plan for Renewable Energy Development, the annual industrial water
   use induced by solar thermal power infrastructure in China is
   accordingly estimated, in magnitude up to around 30\% of the total
   industrial freshwater use in Beijing in the year 2014, one-fourth of
   that in Tianjin, and one-tenth of that in Shanxi, respectively. In the
   long term water-saving planning, the promotion of solar power
   installations is afforded further consideration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{There is a large amount of water consumption embodied in energy
   production. Driven by a growing population and economy, the energy
   sector will continue to expand, increasing more pressure on the fresh
   water demand of countries. This paper analyzes the energy-water nexus
   embodied in international energy trade via a combination of input-output
   analysis (IOA) and ecological network analysis (ENA). The energy-water
   element nexus is depicted based on a mixed-unit IOA to investigate the
   parallel relationship between energy and water. ENA is used to uncover
   energy-water pathways intertwined in global energy trade and identify
   the pair-wise relationship between countries according to the
   energy-water pathway nexus. Then, a case study of the international
   energy-water nexus of China is conducted. The results of energy-water
   nexus element analysis show that water use per unit of energy products
   in the country is much greater than those of other countries. Moreover,
   indirect water use during energy production deserves more attention,
   which is often neglected in water resource management. The results of
   energy-water nexus pathway analysis demonstrate that international
   energy trade has a positive effect on China's water condition,
   mitigating serious water shortage problems but increasing dependency on
   other countries and regions. Mutual relationships among trading
   countries are described using utility and control analyses. The results
   show that system integrality is arguably more critical in determining
   system behavior than direct effects alone. Europe changes from a
   beneficiary in direct mutual relationships to a contributor in integral
   utility mutual relationships, whereas Australia has an opposite change.
   Although China has a dominant position in direct relationships, it
   becomes an equal competitor with the USA in utility mutual
   relationships. China depends heavily on most countries, especially those
   in South and Central America, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia.
   The network mutualism index (=0.56) and synergism index (=9.187)
   indicate that the current global energy trade network has negative
   relationships within a competitive environment. Finally, policy and
   economic suggestions are put forward to alleviate the potential impacts
   of international energy trade on water scarcity in China. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{According to the Vision 2023 agenda, the Turkish government plans to
   produce 30\% of Turkey's electricity demand from renewable energy
   sources in 2023. This means hydroelectric, wind and solar energy
   capacities would increase to 36,000 MW, 20,000 MW and 3000 MW,
   respectively. Increased hydroelectric capacity would indeed benefit
   stability and flexibility of the existing energy infrastructure.
   However, increased wind and solar capacity could bring intermittency
   problems due to nature of these energy sources. Recently, pumped
   hydroelectric energy storage (PHES) has become a hot topic in Turkey.
   And, its potential applications via synergistic utilisation with wind
   and solar energy to solve the aforementioned intermittency problems is
   being discussed. Yet, detailed information in the literature about PHES
   in Turkey is scarce. Therefore, this paper was intended to provide this
   crucial information. Detailed analysis showed even if all obstacles are
   overcome and all potential PHES capacity is used PHES could only provide
   a storage capacity worth equivalent to 0.6-0.8\% of Turkey's annual
   electricity demand in 2023. It is estimated that the overnight capital
   cost required to develop this PHES potential is between 3.6 and 6.5
   billion US\$. Even so, there would be serious economic risks of PHES
   plants. Because, PHES systems are currently net consumers of energy.
   Current study also showed that instead of focusing on PHES, flexibility
   of Turkish electricity market could be sustained by diversifying energy
   sources and increasing nuclear energy capacity. It is estimated that an
   additional 490 MW of nuclear capacity could provide the same potential
   PHES capacity. By this way, intermittency problems associated with
   increased share of solar and wind energy can be easily tackled without
   imperilling the Vision 2023 energy targets.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a cost optimal 100\% renewable energy based system is
   obtained for Southeast Asia and the Pacific Rim region for the year 2030
   on an hourly resolution for the whole year. For the optimization, the
   region was divided into 15 sub-regions and three different scenarios
   were set up based on the level of high voltage direct current grid
   connections. The results obtained for a total system levelized cost of
   electricity showed a decrease from 66.7 (sic) / MWh in a decentralized
   scenario to 63.5 (sic) / MWh for a centralized grid connected scenario.
   An integrated scenario was simulated to show the benefit of integrating
   additional demand of industrial gas and desalinated water which provided
   the system the required flexibility and increased the efficiency of the
   usage of storage technologies. This was reflected in the decrease of
   system cost by 9.5\% and the total electricity generation by 5.1\%.
   According to the results, grid integration on a larger scale decreases
   the total system cost and levelized cost of electricity by reducing the
   need for storage technologies due to seasonal variations in weather and
   demand profiles. The intermittency of renewable technologies can be
   effectively stabilized to satisfy hourly demand at a low cost level. A
   100\% renewable energy based system could be a reality economically and
   technically in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Rim with the cost

Abstract = {{This paper presents a case history of the 205 m high intake slope at the
   Huangjinping (HJP) hydropower station on the Dadu River. Deformation and
   cracks developed on the cut slope during excavation, and the deformation
   extended onto the natural slope above the cut, giving rise to serious
   safety concerns. Research was conducted to study the engineering
   geological conditions and the deformation characteristics of the slope
   during excavation. In situ monitoring data and possible causes of
   cracking were analyzed. The results show that the zone of loosened rock
   mass extended much deeper into the rock mass than it did at other sites
   in the region because of the tectonic history of the site and cutting.
   The empirically designed cable anchors with lengths of 40 m or 45 m were
   insufficient to stabilize the slope, while the remedial cable anchors as
   long as 100 m successfully stabilized the slope. The analytic method and
   procedure used in this paper could be useful to similar projects. (c)

Abstract = {{Hydropower is the leading renewable source of electricity generation and
   a low emission energy source. In order to be developed sustainably, it
   is important that its costs and benefits are adequately set and
   distributed. Different mechanisms, such as royalties, can be used for
   this purpose. Governments have usually kept hydropower royalty rates
   low, without internalizing negative externalities. This strategy is
   inefficient because it leads to larger electricity production and
   consumption, and hence exacerbates environmental impacts. This paper
   reviews the criteria proposed and used to set hydropower royalties. It
   also compares practices of the four main hydropower producers in the
   world: China, Brazil, Canada and the United States. Results show that
   royalty rates and distribution policies are determined in an arbitrary
   and unsystematic manner, but also that water use is usually undervalued.
   In order to encourage the development of this key renewable resource, in
   a sustainable and responsible way, national and international efforts
   should be made to rationalize and harmonize hydropower royalty rates.}},

Abstract = {{The people's perception on environmental and socio-economic impacts due
   to three hydro-electric projects (HEPs; commissioned and under
   construction) were studied in the north-west Indian Himalaya. Surveys
   among 140 project-affected people (PAPs) using a checklist of impacts
   indicate that among the negative impacts, decrease in flora/fauna,
   agriculture, flow of river, aesthetic beauty; and increase in water
   pollution, river bed quarrying for sand/stone, human settlement on river
   banks and social evils; and among the positive impacts, increase in
   standard of living, road connectivity, means of transport, public
   amenities, tourism and environmental awareness were related with HEPs.
   The PAPs tend to forget the negative impacts with the age of the HEPs
   after it becomes functional, and the positive impacts seem to outweigh
   the negative impacts. Study concludes that it is difficult to separate
   the compounding impacts due to HEP construction and other anthropogenic
   and natural factors, and in the absence of cause-and-effect analyses, it
   is hard to dispel the prevailing notion that HEPs are undesirable in the
   study area that led to agitations by the environmentalists and stopped
   construction of one of these HEPs. To overcome the situation,
   multi-disciplinary scientific studies involving the PAPs need to be
   carried out in planning and decision-making to make HEPs environment
   friendly and sustainable in this region. There is also a need to adopt
   low carbon electric power technologies and promote a decentralized
   energy strategy through joint ventures between public and private

Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{38-45}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Over the past decade, adaptation has emerged as an important risk
   management strategy to address climate change and avoid adverse
   consequences. These endeavors overwhelmingly focus on actions within
   sectors and thus fail to account for coupled effects across systems.
   This paper focuses on adaptation constraints that arise from the
   interdependencies of coupled systems, and the opportunities that emerge
   when adaptation strategies integrate such interdependencies. Three
   general constraints to adaptation in coupled systems are identified and
   detailed using evidence from the United States energy water nexus:
   insufficient data and information, path dependence, and institutional
   fragmentation and disorganization. Adaptation constraints within the
   energy-water nexus are especially difficult to avoid or overcome at
   local and regional scales owing to complex, and poorly integrated,
   governance structures. This indicates that some degree of national
   coordination is an important enabling condition to overcome constraints
   and enable adaptation throughout the energy-water nexus. (C) 2017

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) strongly influences the global
   climate system, affecting hydrology in many of the world's river basins.
   This raises the prospect of ENSO-driven variability in global and
   regional hydroelectric power generation. Here we study these effects by
   generating time series of power production for 1593 hydropower dams,
   which collectively represent more than half of the world's existing
   installed hydropower capacity. The time series are generated by forcing
   a detailed dam model with monthly-resolution, 20th century inflows-the
   model includes plant specifications, storage dynamics and realistic
   operating schemes, and runs irrespectively of the dam construction year.
   More than one third of simulated dams exhibit statistically significant
   annual energy production anomalies in at least one of the two ENSO
   phases of El Nino and La Nina. For most dams, the variability of
   relative anomalies in power production tends to be less than that of the
   forcing inflows-a consequence of dam design specifications, namely
   maximum turbine release rate and reservoir storage, which allows inflows
   to accumulate for power generation in subsequent dry years. Production
   is affected most prominently in Northwest United States, South America,
   Central America, the Iberian Peninsula, Southeast Asia and Southeast
   Australia. When aggregated globally, positive and negative energy
   production anomalies effectively cancel each other out, resulting in a
   weak and statistically insignificant net global anomaly for both ENSO
   phases.}},

Title = {{Hydropower versus irrigation-an analysis of global patterns}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Numerous reservoirs around the world provide multiple flow regulation
   functions; key among these are hydroelectricity production and water
   releases for irrigation. These functions contribute to energy and food
   security at national, regional and global levels. While reservoir
   operations for hydroelectricity production might support irrigation,
   there are also well-known cases where hydroelectricity production
   reduces water availability for irrigated food production. This study
   assesses these relationships at the global level using machine-learning
   techniques and multi source datasets. We find that 54\% of global
   installed hydropower capacity (around 507 thousand Megawatt) competes
   with irrigation. Regions where such competition exists include the
   Central United States, northern Europe, India, Central Asia and Oceania.
   On the other hand, 8\% of global installed hydropower capacity (around
   79 thousand Megawatt) complements irrigation, particularly in the Yellow
   and Yangtze River Basins of China, the East and West Coasts of the
   United States and most river basins of Southeast Asia, Canada and
   Russia. No significant relationship is found for the rest of the world.
   We further analyze the impact of climate variables on the relationships
   between hydropower and irrigation. Reservoir flood control functions
   that operate under increased precipitation levels appear to constrain
   hydroelectricity production in various river basins of the United
   States, South China and most basins in Europe and Oceania. On the other
   hand, increased reservoir evaporative losses and higher irrigation
   requirements due to higher potential evaporation levels may lead to
   increased tradeoffs between irrigation and hydropower due to reduced
   water availability in regions with warmer climates, such as India, South
   China, and the Southern United States. With most reservoirs today being
   built for multiple purposes, it is important for policymakers to
   understand and plan for growing tradeoffs between key functions. This
   will be particularly important as climate mitigation calls for an
   increase in renewable energy while agro-hydrological impacts of climate
   change, population and economic growth and associated dietary change
   increase the need for irrigated food production in many regions round
   the world.}},

   Dynamics on China's Terrestrial Species Richness}},
Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Water-energy dynamics broadly regulate species richness gradients but
   are being altered by climate change and anthropogenic activities;
   however, the current methods used to quantify this phenomenon overlook
   the non-linear dynamics of climatic time-series data. To analyze the
   gradient of species richness in China using water-energy dynamics, this
   study used linear regression to examine how species richness is related
   to (1) the long-term mean of evapotranspiration (ET) and potential
   evapotranspiration (PET) and (2) the temporal stability of ET and PET.
   ET and PET were used to represent the water-energy dynamics of the
   terrestrial area. Changes in water-energy dynamics over the 14-year
   period (2000 to 2013) were also analyzed. The long-term mean of ET was
   strong and positively (R-2 is an element of (0.40 similar to 0.67), p <
   0.05) correlated with the species richness gradients. Regions in which
   changes in land cover have occurred over the 14-year period (2000 to
   2013) were detected from long-term trends. The high level of species
   richness in all groups (birds, mammals, and amphibians) was associated
   with relatively high ET, determinism (i.e., predictability), and entropy
   (i.e., complexity). ET, rather than PET or temporal stability measures,
   was an effective proxy of species richness in regions of China that had
   moderate energy (PET > 1000 mm/year), especially for amphibians. In
   addition, predictions of species richness were improved by incorporating
   information on the temporal stability of ET with long-term means.
   Amphibians are more sensitive to the long-term ET mean than other groups
   due to their unique physiological requirements and evolutionary
   processes. Our results confirmed that ET and PET were strongly and
   significantly correlated with climatic and anthropogenic induced
   changes, providing useful information for conservation planning.
   Therefore, climate management based on changes to water-energy dynamics
   via land management practices, including reforestation, should be
   considered when planning methods to conserve natural resources to
   protect biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{It is of importance to investigate watershed water-energy balance
   variations and to explore their correlations with vegetation and soil

   framework in the Wei River Basin (WRB) and its sub-basins aiming to
   examine the validity of stationary assumptions. Additionally, the cross
   wavelet analysis was applied to explore the correlations between
   vegetation and soil moisture dynamics and to variations. Results
   indicated that (1) the omega variations in the WRB are significant, with
   some change points identified except for the sub-basin above
   Zhangjiashan, implying that the stationarity of omega series in the WRB
   is invalid except for the sub-basin above Zhangjiashan; (2) the
   correlations between soil moisture series and to series are weaker than
   those between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) series and
   omega series; (3) vegetation dynamics show significantly negative
   correlations with omega variations in 1983-2003 with a 4-8 year signal

Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles mosquitoes are the only vectors of human malaria.
   Anopheles species use standing water as breeding sites. Human
   activities, like the creation of an artificial lake during the
   implementation of hydroelectric power plants, lead to changes in
   environmental characteristics and, therefore, may changes the species
   richness and composition of Anopheles mosquitoes. The aim of the present
   study was to verify whether or not there is an association between the
   artificial flooding resulting from the construction of the Jirau
   hydroelectric power plant, and the richness and composition of
   anophelines.
   Methods: Mosquitoes samples were obtained monthly from the Jirau
   hydroelectric power plant area located at Porto Velho, Rondnia State,
   using Human Landing Catch (06:00-10: 00 PM). Mosquitoes collected were
   transported to Laboratorio de Entomologia Medica FIOCRUZ-RO where they
   were identified until species using dichotomous key.
   Results: A total of 6347 anophelines belonging to eight different
   species were collected. The anophelines species richness was
   significantly lower during the first flooding stage. Differences in
   anophelines species composition were found when comparing the first
   flooding stage with the other stages. Furthermore, the mean number of
   Anopheles darlingi, the main vector of malaria in the region, increases
   during the first and the third flooding stages.
   Conclusions: The continual monitoring of these vectors during the late
   operational phase may be useful in order to understand how anophelines
   will behave in this area. Keywords: Amazon, Malaria, Human activity,

Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{695-715}},

Abstract = {{One of the technologies that stand out as an alternative to provide
   additional flexibility to power systems with large penetration of
   variable renewable energy (VRE), especially for regions with high direct
   normal irradiation (DNI), is concentrated solar power (CSP) plants
   coupled to thermal energy storage (TES) and back-up (BUS) systems.
   Brazil can develop this technology domestically, especially in its
   Northeast region, where most of VRE capacity is being deployed and where
   lies most of the CSP potential of the country. This work applies the
   Capacity Expansion Model REMix-CEM, which allows considering dispatch
   constraints of thermal power plants in long-term capacity expansion
   optimization. REMix-CEM calculates the optimal CSP plant configuration
   and its dispatch strategy from a central planning perspective. Results
   showed that the hybridization of CSP plants with jurema-preta biomass
   (CSP-BIO) becomes a least-cost option for Brazil by 2040. CSP-BIO
   contributes to the Northeast power system by regularizing the energy
   imbalance that results from the large-scale VRE expansion along with
   conventional inflexible power plants. CSP-BIO plants are able to
   increase frequency response and operational reserve services and can
   provide the required additional flexibility that the Northeast power
   system of Brazil will require into the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Accounting for more than 16\% of the world's net electricity production,
   hydropower is one of the most commonly used renewable sources of energy.
   Small-scale hydropower (SSH) systems are becoming increasingly
   successful options for hydropower generation, particularly in small
   localities and remote areas. Regardless of its low capacity, small-scale
   hydropower produces cheap, clean, and reliable electricity. The
   objective of this study is to provide a sustainable and economical
   solution for the increasing demand of electricity through small-scale
   hydropower generation in Pakistan. River flow and low head potential
   were investigated at twenty sites along the Upper Swat Canal and Swat
   River for hydropower generation. The sites were selected based on large
   differential head, velocity, ease of access, close proximity to dense
   population, and structural support. Hydropower capacity was calculated
   for each site based on the collected flow and hydraulic data. The cost
   per kWh of energy generated has been estimated by dividing the average
   annual recurring cost with annual generation over the lifetime of the
   project. Cost analysis indicated that purchasing one unit at 0.04 US\$
   is suitable for both the consumer and the government. Results revealed
   that each site is qualified to provide stable energy to more than 1500
   houses based on the maximum consumption per home. The cost of the
   proposed power system was identified as the incentive factor in this
   study. In addition to the minimal variation in the seasonal production,
   the studied sites produced as much as 21\% of the total Swat River
   production. The proposed spatial power distribution scenarios have
   contributed a potentially flexible alternative and cost-effective
   solution to the proposed SSH system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Groundwater levels in eight observation wells at 30 min intervals during

   Cretaceous phreatic aquifer were 6.15 and 12.48 mm/d. The unusual hourly
   hydrographs fall into three patterns (mutational, irregular and gradual

   may be related to the presence of the mudstone lenses. The extent of the

   Delhi's community-wide food demand includes household consumption by

   depends 90\%, 76\%, and 86\% on trans-boundary supply of FEW,
   respectively. Supply chain data reveal unique features of trans-boundary
   FEW production regions (e.g. irrigation-electricity needs and GHG
   intensities of power-plants), yielding supply chain-informed coupled
   energy-water-GHG footprints of FEW provisioning to Delhi. Agri-food
   supply contributes to both GHG (19\%) and water-footprints (72\%-82\%)
   of Delhi's FEW provisioning, with milk, rice and wheat dominating these
   footprints. Analysis of FEW interactions within Delhi found > 75\%
   in-boundary water-use for food is for urban agriculture and > 76\%

   waste-to-energy and energy-intensity of commercial and industrial food

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Electricity generated by hydro power is the most widely used form of
   renewable energy, and as such, its vulnerability to climate change is of
   great interest. The aim of this work is to estimate the change in river
   discharge characteristics in the Alpine region due to possible impacts
   of climate and the related changes in the power generation of
   run-of-river hydro power plants up to 2050. Four representative
   bias-corrected climate simulations from the ENSEMBLES project are chosen
   based on the SRES greenhouse gas emission scenario pathway A1B. Data of
   these simulations serve as input for a lumped-parameter rainfall-runoff
   model at a monthly time step, which is calibrated on discharge data of
   gauging stations along important rivers in the Alpine region. A power
   plant model fed with runoff data generated by the hydrological model is
   used to compute changes in the long-term average annual net electrical
   energy output of hydro power plants for the whole Alpine region; while
   the model for Austria is based on known technical parameters of the
   power plants, a more simplified approach is employed elsewhere. The
   general warming trend observed in all four climate scenarios causes to
   various degrees a seasonal shift towards earlier runoff. However, more
   diverse changes in precipitation for the different climate scenarios and
   time periods result in diverging hydrological projections. Although the
   annual runoff is found to decrease in some scenarios, the generally
   observed shift of runoff towards the winter season that typically shows
   higher energy consumption in the Alpine region suggests that the overall
   impact for the electricity sector tends to be positive rather than
   negative. Estimated changes in the average annual electricity generation
   of run-of-river plants are generally found to be within a single-digit
   percentage range but can be either positive or negative depending on the
   climate scenario. The estimated ranges reflect the diversity
   (uncertainty) of the climate models; the total bandwidth of possible
   changes in the water availability and hydro power generation in the
   Alpine region up to 2050 is assumed to be even higher, because of other
   uncertainties in the model chain that are not explicitly considered
   here. Nevertheless, as the general regional trends and bandwidth of
   changes in runoff and hydro power production strongly depend on the
   future changes in precipitation, the results of this work provide
   reasonable orders of magnitude of expected changes and are seen as a
   first step towards an improved understanding of climate impacts on hydro
   power production within the entire Alpine region.}},

   impoundment, peaking after 4-11 yr in nonpiscivorous species and after
   9-14 yr in piscivorous species, at levels 2-8 times higher than those
   measured in surrounding natural lakes. In fish of standardized length,
   maximum levels reached 0.33-0.72 mu g g(-1) in nonpiscivorous species
   and 1.65-4.66 mu g g(-1) in piscivorous species. Depending on the
   reservoir, the return to levels equivalent (p < 0.05) to those found in
   fish in surrounding natural lakes was completed after 10-20 yr for all
   nonpiscivorous species and after 20-31 yr in most piscivorous species,
   if no additional flooding occurred. These results tend to confirm the
   findings of other authors suggesting that the following reservoir
   characteristics play a major role in determining the intensity and
   duration of after-impoundment THg increases in fish: flooded area,
   annual volume of water flowing through the reservoir, filling period,
   water temperature, and percentage of flooded area located in the
   drawdown zone.}},

Abstract = {{In order to reveal the influence of hydropower development on river
   ecology, we selected a number of research sites, including a natural
   channel (NC), a channel reservoir (CR), and a channel below the dam (CB)
   of a certain dam-type hydropower station on the Red River in China. We
   used the Ecopath model to analyze the differences in structures and
   energy characteristics of the three ecosystems. As indicated from the
   results, the energy flow in the three ecosystems of NC, CR, and CB
   mainly flows between trophic levels I and IV, and the overall transfer
   efficiencies of the three ecosystems are characterized by CR < NC < CB.
   The output of primary producers in the three ecosystems are,
   respectively, 852 t.km(-2).y(-1), 3780 t.km(-2).y(-1), and 1842.3
   t.km(-2).y(-1), and the recycling flows into the detritus are 49.37\%,
   48.46\%, and 79.79\% respectively. There are two major trophic transfer
   paths in the three ecosystem food webs, namely the detrital food chain
   and the grazing food chain. Through the comparison and analysis of the
   overall characteristics of the system, we found that the indicators
   reflecting system maturity - including total primary production/total
   respiration (TPP/TR), connectance index (CI), system omnivory index
   (SOI), Finn's cycling index (FCI), and Finn's mean path length (FML) -
   indicate that the maturity of the ecosystem of CB is lower than that of
   NC, and is much lower than that of CR. The results show that the
   ecosystems of CR, NC, and CB, respectively, are in basically mature,
   immature, and unstable ``young{''} states. This trophic model analysis
   also provides a new research perspective on the studies of the influence
   of hydropower development on riverine ecology.}},

Abstract = {{In Turkey and the world, utilization of renewable energy sources is
   gaining importance in order to procure sustainable development along
   with the increase in energy demand and decrease in petroleum based
   energy sources. The most important renewable energy resources include
   hydroelectric, solar, wave and wind energies. Hydroelectric energy
   provides a safe and clean power supply to Turkey with positive effects
   on environment and climate, less cost in operation and maintenance,
   being long-lasting and domestic nature. Especially hydroelectric
   production of all renewable energy resources in Turkey is becoming
   increasingly significant in total electricity production in that it has
   reached 16.1\% in 2015 while it was only 3.8\% in 1950.
   Small scale hydroelectric power plants are favored among clean energy
   resources since they are easily established, mostly sustainable and
   cheaper to operate. Pumped Hydropower Storage (PHS) systems have become
   common recently since they store energy in the form of water in an upper
   reservoir, pumped from another reservoir at a lower elevation. During
   periods of high electricity demand, power is generated by releasing the
   stored water through turbines in the same manner as a conventional
   hydropower station. On the other hand, during periods of low demand
   (usually nights or weekends when electricity is also lower cost), the
   upper reservoir is recharged by using lower-cost electricity from the
   grid to pump the water back to the upper reservoir. Furthermore, they
   can be operated every hour of the day when interconnected with renewable
   energy sources such as wind and solar to obtain maximum efficiency.
   In reality PHS's do not provide means to produce net gain in electricity
   but they are economically viable due to new pricing policies and can
   balance the load in the grid. In this study, general status of energy
   and hydropower of Turkey is investigated, and a proposal for a pumped
   hydropower storage in the Western Black Sea Region of Turkey is
   presented.}},

   Uttarakhand, India. For analysis, 168 soil samples were divided into
   eight groups according to altitudes. In soil samples, the concentration
   levels of Cr and Cu were found more than their background and threshold
   limit. Moreover, the evaluation of geochemical index (I-geo), enrichment
   factor (EF), and contamination factor (CF) suggests that soil samples
   were reasonably contaminated and highly enriched in Rb. The pollution
   load index (PLI) and degree of contamination (Cd) revealed that the
   presence of contaminations (PLI: 1.44; Cd: 44.94) in the study site
   might be a possible health risk for local residents. However, the
   calculation pollution ecological risk index (PERI) suggests low
   ecological risk (PERI: 77.61) of these elements. The clustering of
   sampling groups contained two clusters: the first cluster comprised F1

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of hydropower exploitation in China, changes
   in runoff and sediment transport have become a significant issue that
   cannot be neglected. In this study, the Han River was selected as a
   study case, where the runoff variation and changes in sediment load at

   in different time periods. The results indicate that impact of cascade
   hydropower exploitation on runoff and sediment transport is
   significantly different even during the same time periods. After
   reservoir regulation, the decreasing of sediment load is faster than
   that of runoff. Strong positive correlation between runoff and sediment
   load exists during different time periods, while reservoir operation
   leads to different turning points at the Baihe, Huangjiagang,
   Huangzhuang, and Xiantao stations in the middle and lower Han River. As
   a key driving factor, runoff variation contributed to sediment transport
   with different impact index C-R The impact index C-R before and after
   the first change point at the Baihe, Huangjiagang, Huangzhuang, and
   Xiantao stations is 43.35\%, - 3.68\%, 11.17\%, and 30.12\%,

   Food-Water-Energy Nexus in Drylands of Africa}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Abstract = {{The two major conservation issues for drylands of Africa are habitat
   loss or degradation and habitat fragmentation, largely from agriculture,
   charcoal production, and infrastructural development. A key question for
   management is how these landscapes can retain their critical ecological
   functions and services, while simultaneously supporting resilient
   livelihoods. It is a clear nexus question involving food (agriculture),
   water, and energy (fuelwood), which is complicated by human-wildlife
   conflicts. While these could appear disparate issues, they are closely
   connected in dryland forest landscapes of Africa where elephants occur
   close to areas of human habitation. For instance, crop failure, whether
   due to weather or wildlife damage, is a key driver for rural farmers
   seeking alternative livelihoods and incomes, one of the commonest being
   charcoal production. Similarly, heavy reliance on wood-based energy
   often leads to degradation of wildlife habitat, which heightens
   competition with wildlife for food and water, increasing the possibility
   of crop-raiding. So, for multifunctional landscapes where elephants
   occur in close proximity with humans, any food-water-energy nexus
   activities toward achieving sustainability and resilience should
   consider human-elephant conflicts (HECs). Here, we broach these
   food-water-energy nexus issues with a focus on dryland areas of Africa
   and HECs. We highlight an ongoing study attempting to address this nexus
   holistically by employing a climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and
   agro-forestry based design, augmented by an elephant deterrent study and
   an eco-charcoal production venture.}},

   in wave power at 9m water depth compared to 30m and the wave power
   available at 5m water depth is 20 to 23\% less than that at 9 m. At 9m

   m(-1) in the post-monsoon period (ONDJ) to 15.2 kW m(-1) in the Indian
   summer monsoon (JJAS) period. During the Indian summer monsoon period,
   the variation of wave power in a day is up to 32 kW m(-1). At 9m water

Abstract = {{Low cost drip irrigation (LCDI) has been a recent introduction to India
   and it may be an inexpensive means of expanding irrigation into
   uncultivated areas, thereby increasing land productivity. This paper is
   structured into two phases. The first phase, presents an assessment of
   different irrigation methods (LCDI, conventional drip irrigation (CDI)
   with single row and paired row, siphon and flood irrigation) on
   sugarcane production. The results showed that cane yield and water
   productivity was significantly increased in both plant and ratoon crop
   of sugarcane owing to the methods of irrigation. Among the methods, LCDI
   recorded 118.6 t ha(-1) of cane yield and it was on par with the single
   row CDI, which recorded the highest mean yield of 120.4 t ha(-1) and
   both are found to be significantly superior to the rest of the
   treatments. The lowest yield was recorded in the treatment of flood
   irrigation (94.40 t ha(-1)). Benefit Cost Ratio analysis confirmed that
   LCDI performed better compared to other irrigation methods. The second
   phase deals with the farmer participatory research demonstrations at
   multi location on evaluation of LCDI with flood irrigation. LCDI out
   performed flood irrigation under all the locations in terms of sugarcane
   yield, soil moisture content, postharvest soil fertility, reduction in
   nutrient transport to surface and ground water, water and energy saving.
   These results suggest that LCDI is a feasible option to increase the
   sugarcane production in water scarcity areas of semiarid agro
   ecosystems, and have long-term sustained economic benefits than flood
   irrigation in terms of water productivity, energy saving and

Abstract = {{China's energy resources and electricity load show reverse regional
   distribution, along with serious imbalance of energy supply and demand
   between eastern and western regions. Inter-regional power transmission
   is considered to be the key strategic measure to balance the national

   this study, a multi-region power sector optimization model is developed
   from the perspective of bottom-up modeling. Power transmission
   technologies are considered in detail. Moreover, the sub-module of
   inter-regional coal transportation is introduced into the model. Based
   on above framework, this study analyzes quantitatively the optimum
   inter-regional power transmission planning under various policy
   scenarios, and estimates its impacts on renewable energy, NOx and SO2
   emissions, and coal transportation from a long-term perspective. The
   results show that ultra high voltage lines will become the main carrier
   of inter-regional power transmission in the future. The construction of
   transmission line between some regions such as from East Inner Mongolia
   to northern China, and from northwest China to central China can bring
   economic savings. Interregional power transmission is an effective way
   to promote the utilization of renewable energy in Inner Mongolia and
   northwest China, and plays an important role in controlling NOx and SO2
   emissions in central and eastern China but has limited effect on the

   (SRO), two-stage stochastic programming (TSP), and mixed integer
   programming (MIP) within a general optimization framework to reflect
   uncertainties expressed as interval values and probability distributions

   pollutants emission reduction levels were designed. The electricity
   generation schemes, facility-expansion, pollutant emission, and system
   cost considering the subsidy policy and air pollution mitigation control

Abstract = {{Constructions of dams/reservoirs all over the world are reported to emit
   significant amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and are considered as
   environmental polluters. Organic carbon is contributed by the forest in
   the catchment, part of soil organic carbon is transported through the
   runoffs to the reservoir and undergoes aerobic and anaerobic degradation
   with time to release GHGs to the atmosphere. Literature reveals that no
   work is available on the estimation of `C' stock of trees of forest
   catchment for assessing/predicting the GHGs emissions from the
   reservoirs to atmosphere. To assess the GHGs emission potential of the
   reservoir, an attempt is made in the study to estimate the `C' stock in
   the forest catchment of Kotli Bhel lA hydroelectric reservoir located in
   Tehri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand, India. For this purpose, the
   selected area was categorized into the site-I, II and III along the
   Bhagirathi River based on type of forest available in the catchment. The
   total carbon density (TCD) of tree species of different forest types was
   calculated using diameter at breast height (dbh) and trees height. The
   results found that the TCD of forest catchment was found 76.96 Mg C
   ha(-1) as the highest at the site-ll and 29.93 Mg C ha(-1) as lowest at
   site-I with mean of 51.50 Mg C ha(-1). The estimated forest `C' stock
   shall be used to know the amount of carbon present before and after
   construction of the dam and to predict net GHGs emissions. The results
   may be helpful to study the potential of a given reservoir to release
   GHG and its subsequent impacts on global warming/climate challenges. (C)

Abstract = {{To reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and help mitigate climate
   change, urban water systems need to be adapted so that electrical energy
   use is minimised. In this study, energy data from 2011 was used to
   quantify energy use in China's urban water supply sector. The objective
   was to calculate the energy co-benefits of urban water conservation
   policies and compare energy use between China and other countries. The
   study investigated influencing factors with the aim of informing the
   development of energy efficient urban water infrastructure. The average
   energy use per cubic metre and per capita for urban water supply in
   China in 2011 was 0.29 kWh/m(3) and 33.2 kWh/cap year, respectively.
   Total GHG emissions associated with energy use in the urban water supply
   sector were 7.63 MtCO(2)e, or carbon dioxide equivalent. Calculations
   using these indicators showed significant energy savings could result
   from water conservation measures. A comparison between provinces of
   China showed a direct correlation between energy intensity of urban
   water supply and the population served per unit length of pipe. This may

Abstract = {{This article is concerned with global optimization of water supply
   system scheduling with pump operations to minimize total energy cost.
   The scheduling problem is first formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer
   nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, accounting for flow rates in
   pipes, operation profiles of pumps, water levels of tanks, and customer
   demand. Binary variables denote on-off switch operations for pumps and
   flow directions in pipes, and nonlinear terms originate from
   characteristic functions for pumps and hydraulic functions for pipes.
   The proposed MINLP model is verified with EPANET, which is a leading
   software package for water distribution system modeling. We further
   develop a novel global optimization algorithm for solving the non-convex
   MINLP problem. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model
   and the efficiency of the tailored global optimization algorithm, we
   present results of two case studies with up to 4 tanks, 5 pumps, 5 check
   valves, and 21 pipes. (c) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {{Climate change will have potentially significant effects on hydropower
   generation due to changes in the magnitude and seasonality of river
   runoff and increases in reservoir evaporation. These physical impacts
   will in turn have economic consequences through both producer revenues
   and consumer expenditures. We analyze the physical and economic effects
   of changes in hydropower generation for the contiguous U. S. in futures
   with and without global-scale greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, and
   across patterns from 18 General Circulation Models. Using a monthly
   water resources systems model of 2119 river basins that routes Simulated
   river runoff through reservoirs, and allocates water to potentially
   conflicting and climate dependent demands, we provide a first-order
   estimate of the impacts of various projected emissions outcomes on
   hydropower generation, and monetize these impacts using outputs from an
   electric sector planning model for over 500 of the largest U.S.
   hydropower facilities. We find that, due to generally increasing river
   runoff under higher emissions scenarios in the Pacific Northwest,
   climate change tends to increase overall hydropower generation in the
   contiguous U.S. During low flow months, generation tends to fall with
   increasing emissions, potentially threatening the estimated low flow,
   firm energy from hydropower. Although global GHG mitigation slows the
   growth in hydropower generation, the higher value placed on carbon-free
   hydropower leads to annual economic benefits ranging from \$1.8 billion
   to \$4.3 billion. The present value of these benefits to the U.S. from
   global greenhouse gas mitigation, discounted at 3\%, is \$34 to \$45

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{711-720}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hydropower is an important renewable energy source, but it can consume a
   lot of water due to evaporation from the reservoir surface, which may
   contribute to water scarcity. Previous studies mostly used a gross
   evaporation approach for water footprint assessment where all the
   evaporation is attributed to hydropower. They fail to consider both
   evapotranspiration before the dam construction, which should be deducted
   from the footprint, and the seasonal storage dynamics of water. These
   considerations are critical for assessing reservoir impacts on water
   scarcity using temporally explicit water stress indices. This study
   seeks to fill this gap: we calculate the water footprints of 1500
   hydropower plants which cover 43\% of the global annual hydroelectricity
   generation. Apart from reduced water availability, alterations of the
   flow regime can also adversely affect ecosystems. Therefore,
   environmental flow requirements are also analysed.
   This novel approach for the water footprint assessment of hydropower
   indicates that previous studies mostly overrated the impacts of
   hydropower on water scarcity, often because reservoirs store water in
   periods of low scarcity and release water during months of high water
   scarcity. By contrast, flow alterations generally affect the environment
   more than water consumption. Since impacts vary broadly among plants,
   plant-specific evaluations are necessary. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{One purpose of the reformation of electric power system in China is to
   enable the power system to absorb a higher proportion of renewable

   highlight in this reformation of electric power system. Under the
   background of reformation in power system, we describe the current
   overall market situation of distributed generation and the situation of
   distributed photovoltaic generation in China and further analyze the
   future policy environment of distributed generation. At the same time,
   we also analyze the system, technical and economic obstacles in the
   development of distributed generation. Market designs are made on
   various aspects like the objective principle, market types (spot market,

Abstract = {{The demand for hydrogen in conventional and unconventional oil refining
   industries is considerable. Currently, the predominant source of
   hydrogen is from fossil fuel production pathways, in particular, steam
   methane reforming (SMR), which incurs a significant greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions footprint. Thus, alternative environmentally benign sources of
   hydrogen will be needed in oil refinery complexes the world over, if
   their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions footprint is to be reduced
   materially. In this paper, an integrated data-intensive techno-economic
   model is developed to provide a credible estimate of hydropower-hydrogen
   production costs in Western Canada. The minimum hydrogen production cost
   for the hydropower-hydrogen plant amounts to \$2.43/kg H-2 this
   corresponds to an electrolyser farm with 90 units of a 3496 kW (760
   Nm(3)/h) rated electrolyser. This cost is competitive with SMR/SMR
   coupled with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) production costs,
   which vary from \$1.87/kg H-2 to \$2.60/kg H-2. This point is buttressed
   by the fact that if existing hydropower plants are used (hence negating
   hydropower capital costs), the minimum production cost amounts to
   \$1.18/kg H-2. Hydrogen from hydro power, under the techno-economic
   conditions considered here, is competitive compared to SMR. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Applications of big data techniques in power system will make

   key technologies, like data analysis, data process, and data
   visualization, the integration and fusion problem in the data warehouse
   plays an important role in the data analysis and mining with high

   various scheduling strategies of extract-transform-load workflows are
   proposed, including round-robin algorithm, minimum-cost algorithm,
   minimum-memory algorithm, and mixture of the minimum-cost and
   minimum-memory algorithm. In combination with above algorithms, a
   workflow is divided into many subflows by effective algorithms, like
   shortest-subflow-first and priority-backfilling algorithms, which can
   further improve the parallel computation ability. Then, the minimum-cost

   minimum-cost and minimum-memory with priority-backfilling algorithm, and
   the minimum-cost and minimum-memory with shortest-subflow-first and

   algorithm is superior to the hybrid prioritization algorithm based on

Abstract = {{Soil erosion and deposition mechanisms play a crucial role in the
   sustainability of both existing reservoirs and newly planned projects.
   Soil erosion is one of the most important factors influencing sediment
   transport yields, and, in the context of existing reservoirs, the
   surrounding watersheds supply both runoff and sediment yield to the
   receiving water body. Therefore, appropriate land management strategies
   are needed to minimize the influence of sediment yields on reservoir
   volume and, hence, the capacity of power generation. In this context,
   soil erosion control measures such as buffer strips may provide a
   practical and low-cost option for large reservoirs, but need to be
   tested at the catchment scale. This paper represents a study case for
   the Itumbiara hydroelectric power plant (HPP) in Brazil. Four different
   scenarios considering radially planted buffer strips of Vetivergrass
   with widths of 20 m, 40 m, 100 m and 200 m are analyzed. A
   semi-distributed hydrological model, SWAT, was used to perform the
   simulations. Results indicate a reduction of sediments transported to
   the reservoir of between 0.2\% and 1.0\% per year is possible with
   buffer strip provision, and that this reduction, over the life of
   Itumbiara HPP, may prove important for lengthening the productivity of

Abstract = {{A stepwise algorithm for determining the intersections between fractures

Abstract = {{The ecological compensation for hydropower development should
   internalize the exterior costs of losses to both humans and the

   accounting method for hydropower resettlement was established in this
   study based on human welfare change. Within it, the preferencesof
   respondents for environmental, social, and cultural attributes can be
   identified and evaluated throughan integration of a choice experiment
   with a random utility model. Thus, the ecological compensationstandard
   for hydropower resettlement could be determined, while various
   compensation schemes can beconsidered for the wetland region in
   accordance with the preferences of re- settlers. With a case study ofthe
   Pondo hydropower resettlement project in Tibet, China, the results
   showed the utility of the respondents for a single attribute ranged from

   the ecological compensation standard for the Pondo hydropower
   resettlement would be set in the range of 90- 127.69 CNY peryear, per

   explained in the paper) sliding along the line of intersection of the
   two discontinuity planes. Intersection of two discontinuities with the
   lower and upper rock slope surfaces can result in forming Standard
   Wedges, Overlying Wedges and No Wedges. Vector procedures are developed
   in the paper to differentiate the aforementioned formation modes for the
   wedges. Vector procedures are then given to calculate the sliding modes,
   sliding directions, maximum safe slope angles and factor of safety for
   the Standard and Overlying wedges. Procedures are also given to
   incorporate the variability of discontinuity orientations and strength
   and to calculate the instability cumulative probabilities corresponding
   to different cut slope dip angles. All these procedures are incorporated
   in a computer code, named PKWSAC. The developed procedure and the
   computer program were then validated by applying them to three examples
   and comparing the results obtained through this procedure with the
   results obtained through Lucas' stereographic procedure {[}Lucas JM
   (1980) Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 17:57-61]. The validated
   procedure was then applied to a rock slope at a hydropower site in China
   to perform both deterministic and probabilistic kinematic wedge
   stability analyses. The paper also shows a comparison between the
   deterministic and probabilistic analyses results.}},

   firstly propose a three-step framework of the ecological-benefit-loss
   evaluation for hydropower projects, in accordance with which an index
   system of riverine wetland ecosystem services valuation was established
   originally. Then we make a quantitative valuation on the change of
   riverine wetland ecosystem services caused by this project. Finally, the
   ecological benefit and loss of the project in the riverine wetland were
   evaluated in two aspects of positive impacts and negative impacts. The
   results showed that (1) the positive impacts of Xiaolangdi reservoir
   mainly included 9 categories of ecosystem services: flood control, ice
   prevention, sedimentation reduction, energy substitution, emission
   reduction benefit, water supply, afforestation, shipping and
   entertainment; the total ecological benefit of the project in the
   riverine wetland was 26.2058 billion yuan. (2) The negative impacts of
   Xiaolangdi reservoir mainly included 5 categories: loss due to land
   submergence, heritage submergence, water and soil erosion, reservoir
   sedimentation and immigration; the total ecological loss of the project
   in the riverine wetland was 24.2167 billion yuan. (3) From 2000 to 2012,

Abstract = {{Small-scale hydropower systems are popular both in the United States and
   much of the developing world due to the emphasis on renewable energy and
   the general cost-competitiveness of hydroelectric power generation. We
   present a novel modeling package, referred to as the Hydropower
   Potential Assessment Tool (HPAT), to assess historic and projected
   future small-scale run-of-river hydropower resource potential at a
   single location or distributed over a study region. HPAT implements a
   fully-distributed streamflow model, which is coupled to a digital
   elevation model to assess hydropower resource potential. To demonstrate
   HPAT, we implement the models for a privately-owned run-of-river
   facility on Falls Creek outside of Sweet Home, Oregon, USA. We use an
   ensemble of Global Climate Models (GCMs) for two future climate
   scenarios to project a plausible range of future changes at this site.
   For the Falls Creek facility, HPAT projects that the timing of peak
   streamflow will shift from spring to winter and that mean annual
   hydropower potential will likely decrease slightly from average
   1980-2010 historic conditions through the end of the 21st century. All

Abstract = {{The ecological protection project of substituting small hydropower for

   It is of great importance to the sustainable development of China in the
   21st century. This paper provides a survey of substituting small
   hydropower for fuel in China. Over the last ten years, using small
   hydropower to replace the rural living fuel in China has resulted in
   great fruits. By the end of 2013, 252 SSHF projects had been completed
   in China, and the newly installed capacity of the SSHF power plants had
   reached 564 MW (MW). The demand of 1.593 million rural residents for
   living fuel and energy had been met in a long term, 6.29 million ac-res
   of the forest area had been protected, and the emission of a large
   amount of pollutants had been decreased. Moreover, many SSHF projects
   all over the country are still under construction. With regard to the
   challenges existing in the development course, some suggestions have
   been proposed. Implementation of the SSHF project will help realize the
   harmonious coexistence between human beings and the nature in China. (C)

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Electric power is required to produce, treat, distribute, and recycle
   water while water is required to generate and consume electricity.
   Naturally, this energy-water nexus is most evident in multi-utilities
   that provide electricity and water but still exists when the nexus has
   distinct organizations as owners and operators. Therefore, the
   sustainability question that arises from energy-water trade-offs and
   synergies is very much tied to the potential for economies of scope.
   Furthermore, in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region,
   multi-utilities are not only common, but also the nexus is particularly
   exacerbated by the high energy intensity of the water supply due to
   limited fresh water resources. The goal of this paper is to identify and
   motivate several opportunities for enhanced integrated operations
   management and planning in the energy-water nexus in multi-utilities in
   the MENA. It proceeds in four parts. First, an exposition of the
   energy-water nexus especially as it applies to the MENA is given. This
   discussion focuses on the electric power system, the potable water
   distribution system, and thirdly, the wastewater distribution system.
   Second, the paper shifts to opportunities in integrated operations
   management highlighted by an energy-water nexus supply-side economic
   dispatch illustration. Thirdly, the discussion shifts to planning
   opportunities for the energy-water nexus for the sustainable development
   of water and energy resources. A concluding section summarizes the

Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Large numbers of households and communities will not be connected to the
   national electricity grid for the foreseeable future due to high cost of
   transmission and distribution systems to remote communities and the
   relatively low electricity demand within rural communities. Small-scale
   hydropower used to play a very important role in the provision of energy
   to urban and rural areas of South Africa. The national electricity grid,
   however, expanded and offered cheap, coal-generated electricity and a
   large number of hydropower systems were decommissioned. In this study, a
   feasibility and implementation model was developed to assist in
   designing and financially evaluating small-scale hydropower (SSHP)
   plants. The implementation model describes steps to be followed in
   identifying a technically possible and economically feasible opportunity
   to develop a SSHP site for rural electrification. The development model
   was used in designing the Kwa Madiba SSHP plant. The Kwa Madiba SSHP
   plant was economically evaluated on net present value, internal rate of
   return, levelised cost of energy, financial payback period and
   cost/benefit ratio. The outcome of this study proved that it is
   technically possible to provide SSHP installations for rural
   electrification in South Africa that are more feasible than local or
   national electricity grid extensions or even alternative energy sources
   such as diesel generators. It was concluded that the levelised cost of
   SSHP projects indicates that the cost of SSHP for low energy generation
   is high compared to levelised cost of coal-fired power generation.
   However, the remoteness of SSHP for rural electrification increases the
   cost of infrastructure to connect remote rural communities to the
   national electricity grid. This provides a low cost/benefit ratio and
   renders technically implementable SSHP projects for rural
   electrification feasible on this basis.}},

Abstract = {{Natural ecosystems in sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing intense
   changes that will probably modify land surface feedbacks and
   consequently the regional climate. In this study, we have analyzed water
   vapor (Q(LE)) and sensible heat (Q(H)) fluxes over a woodland
   (Bellefoungou, BE) and a cultivated area (Nalohou, NA) in the Sudanian
   climate of Northern Benin, using 2years (from July 2008 to June 2010) of
   eddy covariance measurements. The evaporative fraction (EF) response to
   environmental and surface variables was investigated at seasonal scale.
   Soil moisture was found to be the main environmental factor controlling
   energy partitioning. During the wet seasons, EF was rather stable with
   an average of 0.750.07 over the woodland and 0.700.025 over the
   cultivated area. This means that 70-75\% of the available energy was
   changed into actual evapotranspiration during the investigated wet
   seasons depending on the vegetation type. The cumulative annual actual
   evapotranspiration (AET) varied between 73050mmyr(-1) at the NA site and
   104070mmyr(-1) at the BE site. With similar weather conditions at the
   two sites, the BE site showed 30\% higher AET values than the NA site.
   The sensible heat flux Q(H) at the cultivated site was always higher
   than that of the woodland site, but observed differences were much less
   than those of Q(LE). In a land surface conversion context, these
   differences are expected to impact both atmospheric dynamics and the
   hydrological cycle.}},

Abstract = {{AimTo assess the largely neglected patterns and causes of latitudinal
   diversity gradients in soil protists, using South American testate
   amoebae as model organisms.
   LocationSouth-western South America (SSA).
   MethodsWe assessed the relationship among richness, latitude and
   predictions of eight ecological hypotheses in SSA, a region
   characterized by harsh abiotic conditions northward and southward from
   mid-latitudes. We also examined the patterns of latitudinal variation in
   species range sizes, species composition and phylogenetic relatedness
   among species to assess whether the responses of species to current
   climate rely on evolutionary constraints.
   ResultsRichness followed a unimodal trend with abrupt declines northward
   and southward from mid-latitudes. This trend was mostly explained by
   water-energy balance. To our knowledge, this mechanism has never been
   reported for soil microorganisms before. Species range sizes were larger
   northward and southward from mid-latitudes, a pattern which we have
   called the two-way Rapoport effect'. Species composition was due to
   turnover at mid-latitudes and to nestedness towards low and high
   latitudes. Species at mid-latitudes tended to be less related to each
   other than those at low and high latitudes, supporting the existence of
   evolutionary constraints to water-energy availability.
   Main conclusionsThe unimodal response of species diversity to water and
   energy availability stems from a combination of the ancestral adaptation
   of testate amoebae to warm, humid climates and past climate changes that
   set up permanent harsh abiotic conditions northward and southward from
   mid-latitudes. Given that other soil microorganisms also depend on water
   and energy to survive and reproduce, we predict that the unimodal
   response to water-energy balance observed will also be valid for a large
   number of microbial groups in SSA. While this diversity trend may not
   hold true for testate amoebae from other regions, we predict that their
   evolutionary constraints to water-energy availability will always
   produce strong relationships among richness, water and energy at large
   spatial-scales.}},

Abstract = {{Background Diet is related to the prevention of chronic diseases, but
   assessing dietary intake is a complex task, especially in socially

   Objectives To assess the accuracy of the 24-hour food recall (24HFR) and
   the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) methods in socially vulnerable
   women in Brazil and compare these methods against doubly labeled water
   (DLW).
   Design Cross-sectional study. Energy intake (EI) was measured using 3
   24HFRs and 1 FFQ, Total energy expenditure (TEE) was measured using DLW.
   Cutoff points were calculated to assess underreporting and overreporting
   using both the difference and the ratio between the El and TEE.
   Participants/setting Sixty-seven socially vulnerable, nondieting adult
   women with stable body weight and mothers of malnourished children.
   Main outcome measures in kilocalories, derived from 24HFR and FFQ.
   Statistical analyses Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to
   compare El and TEE and Bland-Altman graphs were plotted to assess the
   agreement between these variables. Spearman correlation coefficient
   between the ratio of El to TEE and socioeconomic or anthropometric
   variables was calculated.
   Results Mean TEE was 2,186 kcal (95\% CI 2,063 to 2,309 kcal). El
   obtained through 24HFR (mean=1,848.6 kcal {[}95\% CI 1,737.5 to 1,959.7
   kcal]) was significantly lower than TEE (P=0.01), and significantly
   lower than the EI obtained through FFQ (meth-1=2,084.5 {[}95\% CI
   1,929.0 to 2,240.0 kcal]; P<0.01). There were no statistically
   significant differences between the EI values of FFQ and TEE (P=0.89).
   The distribution of under reporters, nonunderreporters, and
   overreporters were more homogenous in the FFQ method. There was a
   positive correlation between body fat percentage and underreporting in
   the FFQ method (r=0.245; P=0.046).
   Conclusions The methods of assessing dietary intake in our study showed
   poor agreement with TEE obtained by DLW. These may, therefore, not be
   the most suitable methods for assessing EI in this population.}},

Abstract = {{In North America, burbot Lota lota (L.), interactions with hydropower
   are common, southern burbot populations are endangered and hydropower
   has been implicated in the decline. Thus, the objectives of this review
   were to identify threats and benefits of hydropower to riverine and
   reservoir dwelling burbot, assess overall impacts and identify key
   research needs for mitigation. Review findings suggest that while winter
   hydropower discharge regimes threaten riverine burbot spawning, burbot
   often successfully exploit reservoir environments. Further, while
   turbine entrainment has been hypothesised as a factor in the decline of
   burbot populations, low adult vulnerability to passage and a high
   resilience to juvenile removals likely mean risk to populations is low.
   Identified research needs include better definitions of flow and
   temperature requirements for riverine burbot and a quantification of the
   potential for reservoirs to act as source populations for downstream
   impacted zones. This review highlights the Pacific watershed focus of
   existing work and calls for status assessments and ecological research

Abstract = {{During the excavation process of underground caverns, the rational
   selection of the ventilation scheme is very important for the safety and
   health of construction workers. The flood discharge tunnel groups at the
   Changheba Hydropower Station are selected as a case to study the design
   of ventilation schemes in inclined tunnel groups; these groups are
   characterized by a gradient of approximately 10\% and a complex
   intersecting relationship among the tunnels. The Computational Fluid
   Dynamics (CFD) method is used to simulate the fluid dynamics in tunnel
   groups when different ventilation schemes are employed. Four ventilation
   schemes with the same duct at different positions along the transverse
   section are formulated, and the scheme approaching the right side with
   most of the construction adits is adopted in engineering after a
   comparative analysis, as it offers a well-distributed velocity field and
   sufficient security distance. The study reveals that flow vortices
   appear in the tunnels with a long axis length ranging from 5 m to 20 m;
   the observation that the flow velocity on the transverse sections is
   away from the heading face indicates that a low-velocity area is always
   present in the vicinity of an air duct, and the security distance on the
   upstream side is 60\% shorter than on the downstream side with the same
   air-blower when the tunnels have a 10\% gradient. In addition, when the
   excavation distance rises 200 m, the ventilation condition in the
   tunnels, especially in the areas around tunnel intersections, is greatly
   improved by the completion of pilot tunnels and shafts in advance. (C)

Abstract = {{The energy sector depends on water in all phases of its life-cycle,
   including raw material extraction, power plant cooling, irrigation of
   biofuel crops and directly in hydropower generation. In the coming
   decades, several regions of the world are expected to experience a
   decrease in water resource availability, in part due to climate change.
   The dependence of the energy sector on water resources calls for an
   active effort to adapt to the possible scenarios. This paper presents a
   novel model that addresses the direct impacts of regional and temporal
   water shortages on energy operation and investment decisions. The paper
   investigates the costs and benefits of adapting the energy sector to
   climate-induced water scarcity. The results show that the increase in
   costs for an energy plan that considers future water stress is
   relatively small as compared to one which ignores it. A plan which
   ignores water constraints, however, may lead to significant economic
   damages when actually exposed to water shortages. The results also
   highlight the value of the availability of water for the energy sector,
   which is significantly higher than existing prices. The paper concludes
   that the potential benefits to be gained by integrating energy and water
   models can be considerable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   experiencing water shortage}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{181}},
Pages = {{403-412}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Water shortage, increased demand and rising energy costs are major
   challenges for the water sector worldwide. Here we use a comparative
   case study to explore the long-term changes in the system-wide water and
   associated energy use in two different regions that encountered water
   shortage. In Australia, South East Queensland (SEQ) encountered a
   drought from 2001 to 2009, while Perth has experienced a decline in
   rainfall since the 1970s. This novel longitudinal study quantifies and
   compares the urban water consumption and the energy use of the water
   supply systems in SEQ and Perth during the period 2002 to 2014. Unlike
   hypothetical and long-term scenario studies, this comparative study
   quantifies actual changes in regional water consumption and associated
   energy, and explores the lessons learned from the two regions. In 2002,
   Perth had a similar per capita water consumption rate to SEQ and 48\%
   higher per capita energy use in the water supply system. From 2002 to
   2014, a strong effort of water conservation can be seen in SEQ during
   the drought, while Perth has been increasingly relying on seawater
   desalination. By 2014, even though the drought in SEQ had ended and the
   drying climate in Perth was continuing, the per capita water consumption
   in SEQ (266 Lipid) was still 28\% lower than that of Perth (368 Lipid),
   while the per capita energy use in Perth (247 kWh/p/yr) had increased to
   almost five times that of SEQ (53 kWhip/yr). This comparative study
   shows that within one decade, major changes in water and associated
   energy use occurred in regions that were similar historically. The very
   different ``water-energy{''} trajectories in the two regions arose
   partly due to the type of water management options implemented,
   particularly the different emphasis on supply versus demand side
   management. This study also highlights the significant energy saving
   benefit of water conservation strategies (i.e. in SEQ the energy saving
   was sufficient to offset the total energy use for seawater desalination
   and water recycling during the period.). The water-energy trajectory
   diagram provides a new way to illustrate and compare longitudinal water
   consumption and associated energy use within and between cities. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The water-energy nexus has been increasingly studied in order to
   elucidate the complex interdependence between water and energy
   resources, and, as a result, enhance management practices to conserve
   both resources alike. In this context, integrated water management plans
   have direct implications on the energy embodied into water and sewerage
   services. The objective of this study is to assess the potential for
   energy savings in water and sewerage services by means of on-site
   integrated water and sewage management strategies in low-income
   households in Florianopolis, Brazil. The studied water efficient
   measures include: (i) installation of water efficient fixtures (dual
   flush toilets and water efficient taps); (ii) reclamation of grey water
   from shower, washing basin, and laundry for toilet flushing; and (iii)
   rainwater use for laundry and toilet flushing. From the combination of
   these measures, the water and energy saving potential of seven
   integrated water and sewage management strategies were studied.
   Moreover, the water consumption pattern at ten low-income households
   with conventional and water efficient taps were empirically determined
   using water smart meters; whereas, the rainwater supply capacity was
   estimated by using the computer programme Netuno 4.0, and the grey water
   supply and sewage reduction capacities were determined using model
   equations. Rainwater harvesting alone appeared as the least favourable
   strategy for energy savings as the energy consumption would increase 4\%
   compared to a centralised system; while the combination of water
   efficient fixtures and grey water reclamation gave rise to the greatest
   energy saving potential (48\%). The findings of this study indicate
   that, from an energy management point of view, the sustainability of the
   water sector is primarily associated with the reduction of effluents to
   centralised systems, rather than the use of alternative water sources.

Abstract = {{Objective: The present study examined plain water consumption in

   Methods: A nationally representative sample of 18 311 adults aged >= 18
   years, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
   2005-2012, was analysed. The first-difference estimator approach
   addressed confounding bias from time-invariant unobservables (e.g.
   eating habits, taste preferences) by using within-individual variations
   in diet and plain water consumption between two nonconsecutive 24-h
   dietary recalls.
   Results: One percentage point increase in the proportion of daily plain
   water in total dietary water consumption was associated with a reduction
   in mean (95\% confidence interval) daily total energy intake of 8.58
   (7.87-9.29) kcal, energy intake from sugar-sweetened beverages of 1.43
   (1.27-1.59) kcal, energy intake from discretionary foods of 0.88
   (0.44-1.32) kcal, total fat intake of 0.21 (0.17-0.25) g, saturated fat
   intake of 0.07 (0.06-0.09) g, sugar intake of 0.74 (0.67-0.82) g, sodium
   intake of 9.80 (8.20-11.39) mg and cholesterol intake of 0.88
   (0.64-1.13) g. The effects of plain water intake on diet were similar
   across race/ethnicity, education attainment, income level and body
   weight status, whereas they were larger among males and
   young/middle-aged adults than among females and older adults,
   respectively. Daily overall diet quality measured by the Healthy Eating
   Index-2010 was not found to be associated with the proportion of daily
   plain water in total dietary water consumption.
   Conclusions: Promoting plain water intake could be a useful public
   health strategy for reducing energy and targeted nutrient consumption in

Abstract = {{Water supply systems have led to the related effects on goals of nation

   work put forward a set of indicator system and the related methods,

   system (TWSS) on national economy, energy and environment from 2000 to
   2013, so as to discover some underlying obstacles hindering the
   sustainable development of China's TWSS. The study results show that (1)
   per capita water use declines by 28.11\% from 102.17 t/person in 2000 to
   73.45 t/person in 2013; (2) the contribution of China's TWSS to national

   3.66\% respectively; (3) the total pollution discharge from this system
   ascends by an annual growth rate of 1.06\%, of which 97.44\% comes from
   sludge discharge in terms of mass; therein, the contribution of COD
   discharge from this system to national COD discharge rises by an annual

Abstract = {{A carbon-nitrogen (C-N) coupled terrestrial ecosystem model,
   CLASS-CTEMN+, was used to simulate global terrestrial carbon, water, and

   Forcing and initializing data sets from the North American Carbon
   Program (NACP)-Multi-Scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model
   Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) were used. Two versions of the model
   (the C-N coupled and the C-only version) were compared. The C-N (C)
   version of the model simulated global annual total gross ecosystem
   productivity (GEP) of 122.7 (128.2) Pg Cyr(-1), ecosystem respiration
   (Re) of 119.1(122.4) Pg Cyr(-1), net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of
   3.64 (5.82) Pg Cyr(-1), net primary productivity (NPP) of 62.7 (67.4) Pg
   Cyr(-1), latent heat (LE) of 146.2 (167.4) ZJ yr(-1), sensible heat (H)
   of 194.0 (162) ZJ yr(-1), soil organic carbon (SOC) of 1230 (1328) Pg C,
   and total vegetation biomass (Tvg) of 608 (629) PgC, over the 1980-2010
   period were comparable to scaled observations and modelling studies in
   the literature. Our results suggest that altough inclusion of N cycling
   has not had a large effect on the simulated total global terrestrial
   ecosystem C budget over this period; however the temporal evolution and
   spatial distribution of the simulated C budget revealed important
   influences of the N cycle. Analysis of long-term annual variations in
   response to evolving climate, CO2 concentration levels, and N deposition
   over the 1901-2010 period showed largely similar increasing trends in
   global GEP, Re, NEP and NPP until about 1970, after which the rate of
   increase was suppressed in the C-N coupled version of the model relative
   to the C-only version. Spatial plots showed that GEP and Re were reduced
   in the C-N coupled version of the model over the temperate and boreal
   regions and in high latitudes, where N limitation is well documented.
   The strongest response in NEP was in the boreal forests of North
   America, Northern Europe and Northwestern Asia, which showed decreases
   in response to the inclusion of a N cycle. Commensurate with the
   reductions in GEP and NEP, leaf area index (LAI) and total vegetation
   biomass (Tvg) also showed decreases in the boreal region, while SOC
   showed wider decreases in temperate, boreal and northern regions.
   This study helps to identify and diagnose the impact of N controls on
   the simulated spatiotemporal patterns of terrestrial C sinks and
   sources, and to evaluate and quantify the variability of simulated N
   cycle effects on different plant functional types (PFTs). These results
   have important implications for future climate change scenarios because
   the response to increasing CO2, N deposition, and climate patterns shows
   diverging model behavior as compared with the C-only version, when a N
   cycle is incorporated in the model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The nexus between energy and water introduces cross-sectoral
   vulnerabilities, which provides crosscutting opportunities to mitigate
   urban energy and water demand pressure. The existing nexus research has
   generally been limited to inventorying energy-related water and
   water-related energy. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework to
   study the interwoven connections of energy consumption and water use for
   urban agglomerations. The energy-related water and water-related energy
   are also systematically inventoried with the multi-regional input-output
   method. Then, a multi-regional nexus network is established, based on
   ecological network analysis, to explore the structural properties and
   sectoral interactions between sectors within urban agglomerations. A
   case study of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region shows the differences of
   direct energy/water and embodied energy/water consumption between
   sectors and regions. There are significant changes of control/dependence
   relationships between sectors and regions after considering the urban
   agglomeration nexus. Also, the effect of the nexus on water networks is
   smaller than energy networks. The nexus effect on energy and water
   networks for Beijing is bigger than those of Tianjin and Hebei. The
   recycling rates in water networks are around 20-23\%, which are lower

   and Beijing are higher than that of Hebei. According to the results of
   energy and water flows between regions, Beijing and Tianjin are
   dependent on Hebei for water and energy resources, while Hebei is more
   self-sufficient. The multi regional network approach presents great
   potential for bridging nexus analysis with sustainable planning for

Abstract = {{Despite significant effort to quantify the interdependence of the water
   and energy sectors, global requirements of energy for water (E4W) are
   still poorly understood, which may result in biases in projections and
   consequently in water and energy management and policy. This study
   estimates water-related energy consumption by water source, sector, and
   process for 14 global regions from 1973 to 2012. Globally, E4W amounted
   to 10.2 EJ of primary energy consumption in 2010, accounting for
   1.7\%-2.7\% of total global primary energy consumption, of which 58\%
   pertains to fresh surface water, 30\% to fresh groundwater, and 12\% to
   nonfresh water, assuming median energy intensity levels. The sectoral
   E4W allocation includes municipal (45\%), industrial (30\%), and
   agricultural (25\%), and main process-level contributions are from
   source/conveyance (39\%), water purification (27\%), water distribution
   (12\%), and wastewater treatment (18\%). While the United States was the
   largest E4W consumer from the 1970s until the 2000s, the largest
   consumers at present are the Middle East, India, and China, driven by
   rapid growth in desalination, groundwater-based irrigation, and
   industrial and municipal water use, respectively. The improved
   understanding of global E4W will enable enhanced consistency of both
   water and energy representations in integrated assessment models.}},

Abstract = {{Concerning the difficulty in quantitatively describing the influence of

   energy stability region (ESR) is proposed in this study based on the

   system, the dynamic damping is energized. Thus power system dynamic
   stability criteria considering both the disturbance magnitude and system
   operation state is obtained. Then, the energy boundary of ESR is
   determined in the energy space according to the criteria, and the
   parameter boundary of ESR is determined in the parameter space combining
   the small signal stability region. On this basis, in the
   parameter-energy multi-dimensional space, the ESR which could reflect
   the dynamic stability and transient stability of power system under
   different disturbances is established. Finally, the ESR of IEEE

   Simulation analysis of different parameter-energy pairs inside and

   applied to discriminating the dominant modes from trivial ones to
   improve the estimation accuracy. Field-measurement data collected by

Abstract = {{A key challenge to understanding ecohydrologic responses to dam
   regulation is the absence of a universally transferable classification
   framework for how dams operate. In the present paper, we develop a
   classification system to organize the modes of operation (MOPs) for US
   hydropower dams and powerplants. To determine the full diversity of
   MOPs, we mined federal documents, open-access data repositories, and
   internet sources. We then used CART classification trees to predict MOPs
   based on physical characteristics, regulation, and project generation.
   Finally, we evaluated how much variation MOPs explained in sub-daily
   discharge patterns for stream gages downstream of hydropower dams. After
   reviewing information for 721 dams and 597 power plants, we developed a
   two-tier hierarchical classification based on (i) the storage and
   control of flows to powerplants, and (ii) the presence of a diversion
   around the natural stream bed. This resulted in nine tier-1 MOPs
   representing a continuum of operations from strictly peaking, to
   reregulating, to run-of-river, and two tier-2 MOPs, representing
   diversion and integral dam-powerhouse configurations. Although MOPs
   differed in physical characteristics and energy production,
   classification trees had low accuracies (62\%), which suggested that
   accurate evaluations of MOPs may require individual attention. MOPs and
   dam storage explained 20\% of the variation in downstream subdaily flow
   characteristics and showed consistent alterations in subdaily flow
   patterns from reference streams. This standardized classification scheme
   is important for future research including estimating reservoir
   operations for large-scale hydrologic models and evaluating project
   economics, environmental impacts, and mitigation. Copyright (c) 2016

Abstract = {{The nexus between water and energy is drawing increasing attention in
   China. The large water requirements for energy production are driving us
   to consider the spillover effects that energy and water policies are
   having on both resources. The present study builds a multi-sectoral
   dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with an energy tax
   module to study the impact on energy and water resources. Based on the
   proposed model, different policy designs with different ad valorem tax
   rates are simulated. The results show that energy production and demand
   would be negatively affected by the reform in terms of output shrinkage
   in most sectors and that the effect will be larger with a higher tax
   rate. The energy structure would be improved, with sharp decreases in
   fossil fuel production and demand, whereas cleaner forms,of energy would
   increase. The water resources required for energy production would be
   significantly decreased based on the energy effect of the energy tax,
   which would also contribute greatly to the achievement of the 3 Redlines
   goals of water conservation. Water conservation policy decreases the
   amount water used by thermal power plants, but increases energy
   consumption. Hence, site-specific factors should be considered when
   determining the sustainable management of water and energy in different
   regions of China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, 98\% of total electricity is currently produced by
   thermoelectric power and hydropower. Climate change is expected to
   directly impact electricity supply, in terms of both water availability
   for hydropower generation and cooling water usage for thermoelectric
   power. Improved understanding of how climate change may impact the
   availability and temperature of water resources is therefore of major
   importance. Here we use a multi-model ensemble to show the potential
   impacts of climate change on global hydropower and cooling water
   discharge potential. For the first time, combined projections of
   streamflow and water temperature were produced with three global
   hydrological models (GHMs) to account for uncertainties in the structure
   and parametrization of these GHMs in both water availability and water
   temperature. The GHMs were forced with bias-corrected output of five
   general circulation models (GCMs) for both the lowest and highest
   representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The ensemble
   projections of streamflow and water temperature were then used to
   quantify impacts on gross hydropower potential and cooling water
   discharge capacity of rivers worldwide. We show that global gross
   hydropower potential is expected to increase between +2.4\% (GCM-GHM
   ensemble mean for RCP 2.6) and +6.3\% (RCP 8.5) for the 2080s compared
   to 1971-2000. The strongest increases in hydropower potential are
   expected for Central Africa, India, central Asia and the northern
   high-latitudes, with 18-33\% of the world population living in these
   areas by the 2080s. Global mean cooling water discharge capacity is
   projected to decrease by 4.5-15\% (2080s). The largest reductions are
   found for the United States, Europe, eastern Asia, and southern parts of
   South America, Africa and Australia, where strong water temperature
   increases are projected combined with reductions in mean annual
   streamflow. These regions are expected to affect 11-14\% (for RCP2.6 and
   the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP)1, SSP2, SSP4) and 41-51\%
   (RCP8.5-SSP3, SSP5) of the world population by the 2080s. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Diversion-type hydroelectric exploitation can reduce instream flow and

   considered an effective way to remediate the damages. The Physical
   Habitat Simulation (PHABSIM) system still probably remains as the most
   widespread habitat method used to establish instream flow standards or
   to link habitat variations with fish population dynamics. This study
   applies the PHABSIM models, which create a habitat-flow relationship,
   describing the physical habitat suitability of alternative instream flow
   releases. Selecting the water-reduction section of the Sangping Power
   Station on the Zagunao River as the research object, the hydraulic
   pressure at a cross section was obtained through habitat simulation. The
   Cyprinidae family of fish, dominant in this region, was targeted using
   velocity and depth suitability curves. The quantitative relationship
   between flow and suitable habitat area was established, with the minimum
   instream flow of the study area calculated as 30.0 m(3)/s, according to
   the weighted usable area-flow curve. The minimum instream flow of the
   study area was also estimated through common hydrologic and hydraulic
   methods. The resulting comparison indicated that the habitat simulation
   model achieved very similar results to those of the wetted perimeter
   method and achieved between ``good{''} and ``very good{''} levels using
   the Tennant method. The result indicates that the PHABSIM model is
   useful for optimizing the flow release schemes of hydropower stations in

Abstract = {{Hydropower is an important renewable energy source in China, but it is
   sensitive to climate change, because the changing climate may alter
   hydrological conditions (e.g., river flow and reservoir storage). Future
   changes and associated uncertainties in China's gross hydropower
   potential (GHP) and developed hydropower potential (DHP) are projected
   using simulations from eight global hydrological models (GHMs),
   including a large-scale reservoir regulation model, forced by five
   general circulation models (GCMs) with climate data under two
   representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Results show
   that the estimation of the present GHP of China is comparable to other
   studies; overall, the annual GHP is projected to change by -1.7 to 2\%
   in the near future (2020-2050) and increase by 3 to 6\% in the late 21st
   century (2070-2099). The annual DHP is projected to change by -2.2 to
   -5.4\% (0.7-1.7\% of the total installed hydropower capacity (IHC)) and
   1.3 to -4\% (0.4-1.3\% of total IHC) for 2020-2050 and 2070-2099,
   respectively. Regional variations emerge: GHP will increase in northern
   China but decrease in southern China - mostly in south central China and
   eastern China - where numerous reservoirs and large IHCs currently are
   located. The area with the highest GHP in southwest China will have more
   GHP, while DHP will reduce in the regions with high IHC (e.g., Sichuan
   and Hubei) in the future. The largest decrease in DHP (in \%) will occur
   in autumn or winter, when streamflow is relatively low and water use is
   competitive. Large ranges in hydropower estimates across GHMs and GCMs
   highlight the necessity of using multimodel assessments under climate
   change conditions. This study prompts the consideration of climate
   change in planning for hydropower development and operations in China,
   to be further combined with a socioeconomic analysis for strategic

Abstract = {{The transmitted radiation into the conventional net-houses is very low
   in the early morning and late afternoon that may not fulfill the crop
   growth requirements. To solve this problem, two types of net house
   models (polygon and curved-arch net-houses) were newly designed, each
   having seven surfaces made up of different net types. The spectral
   radiative properties of 32 nets were examined and three nets were
   selected to cover the surfaces of each model. The two designs showed
   high transmittance in the morning and afternoon, and low at around noon
   (U shape). The polygon style was scaled up and an experiential net-house
   was constructed with a floor area of 28 m(2). An evaporatively-cooled
   greenhouse with a floor area of 28 m(2) was used for comparison; each
   floor was planted with 500 potted Chrysanthemum plant. The results
   showed that the. PAR and microclimate in the net-house and cooled
   greenhouse were similar. The net-house reduced water consumption by 13
   kg m(-2) day(-1) in summer and by 0.94 kg m(-2) day(-1) in winter; and
   reduced electric energy consumption by 0.26 kw-h m(-2) day(-1) in summer

Abstract = {{Run of the river (RoR) hydropower projects are generally considered more
   environmentally sustainable as compared to their reservoir based
   counterparts. Further, impacts of these projects are supposed to be in
   proportion to their installed capacity. Large numbers of this category
   of hydropower projects in different size ranges are coming up in
   Himalayan regions. Un-sustainable construction operation practices
   adopted during development and/or running of these projects are posing
   an environmental threat to this fragile and youngest mountain range of
   the world. This research paper presents a public perception cum data
   collection study on the environmental impacts of small and large RoR
   hydropower projects located in western Himalayan region of India. A
   structured questionnaire was designed to collect the primary data
   pertaining to intangible impacts while secondary data was collected to
   analyse tangible environmental parameters. The study concludes that
   every environmental impact of SHPs is not `small' as compared to LHPs.
   Ignoring the environmental impacts of SHPs may not be a good practice.

Abstract = {{This study assessed surface water and energy budgets in Atmospheric
   Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) simulations of a coupled
   atmosphere-land model developed by Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory
   (Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AM2.5)). The AM2.5 water and

   an observational-based reference, the Variable Infiltration Capacity
   model simulations forced by Princeton Global Meteorological Forcing
   (PGF/VIC) over 20year period during 1991-2010 in nine African river
   basins. Results showed that AM2.5 has closed water and energy budgets.
   However, the discrepancies between AM2.5 and other data sets were
   notable in terms of their long-term averages. For the water budget, the
   AM2.5 mostly overestimated precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff
   compared to PGF/VIC and reanalyses. The AM2.5, reanalyses, and PGF/VIC
   showed similar seasonal cycles but discrepant amplitudes. For the energy
   budget, while the AM2.5 has relatively consistent net radiation with
   other data sets, it generally showed higher latent heat, lower sensible
   heat, and lower Bowen ratio than reanalyses and PGF/VIC. In addition,
   the AM2.5 water and energy budgets terms mostly had the smallest
   interannual variability compared to both reanalyses and PGF/VIC. The
   spatial differences of long-term mean precipitation, runoff,
   evapotranspiration, and latent heat between AM2.5 and other data sets
   were reasonably small in dry regions. On average, AM2.5 is closer to
   PGF/VIC than R2 and 20CR are to PGF/VIC but is not as close as
   Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications and
   Climate Forecast System Reanalysis to PGF/VIC. The bias in AM2.5 water
   and energy budget terms may be associated with the excessive wet surface

   576 h of data) are used for the coupled evaluation of both below-and
   aboveground processes from three global reanalysis products and six
   global land data assimilation products. All products show systematic
   errors in precipitation, snow depth, and the timing of the melting and
   onset of snow. Despite the biases in soil moisture, all products show
   significant correlations with observed daily soil moisture for the
   periods with unfrozen soil. While errors in 2-m air temperature are
   highly correlated with errors in skin temperature for all sites, the
   correlations between skin and soil temperature errors are weaker,
   particularly over the sites with seasonal snow. While net short-and
   longwave radiation flux errors have opposite signs across all products,
   the net radiation and ground heat flux errors are usually smaller in
   magnitude than turbulent flux errors. On the other hand, the all-product

   Southwestern China}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This study focused on landslide susceptibility analysis mapping of the
   Xulong hydropower station reservoir, which is located in the upstream of
   Jinsha River, a rapidly uplifting region of the Tibetan Plateau region.
   Nine factors were employed as landslide conditioning factors in
   landslide susceptibility mapping. These factors included the slope
   angle, slope aspect, curvature, geology, distance-to-fault,
   distance-to-river, vegetation, bedrock uplift and annual precipitation.
   The rapid bedrock uplift factor was represented by the slope angle. The
   eight factors were processed with the information content model. Since
   this area has a significant vertical distribution law of precipitation,
   the annual precipitation factor was analyzed separately. The analytic
   hierarchy process weighting method was used to calculate the weights of
   nine factors. Thus, this study proposed a component approach to combine
   the normalized eight-factor results with the normalized annual
   precipitation distribution results. Subsequently, the results were
   plotted in geographic information system (GIS) and a landslide
   susceptibility map was produced. The evaluation accuracy analysis method
   was used as a validation approach. The landslide susceptibility classes
   were divided into four classes, including low, moderate, high and very
   high. The results show that the four susceptibility class ratios are
   12.9\%, 35.06\%, 34.11\% and 17.92\% of the study area, respectively.
   The red belt in the high elevation area represents the very high
   susceptibility zones, which followed the vertical distribution law of
   precipitation. The prediction accuracy was 85.74\%, which meant that the
   susceptibility map was confirmed to be reliable and reasonable. This
   susceptibility map may contribute to averting the landslide risk in the
   future construction of the Xulong hydropower station.}},

   globally and in 13 newly defined offshore provinces. We show that for
   optimum fresh weight stocking density of 4 kg m(-2) the total potential
   of offshore cultivated Ulva biomass is of the order of 10(11) dry weight
   (DW) ton year(-1), over a surface area of similar to 10(8) km(2). We
   found that the distance of the offshore cultivation site to the
   processing facility is limited to 114-689 km, depending on cargo
   moisture content. The near-future technologically deployable areas,
   associated with up to 100 m water installation depth, and 400 km

   modeled the potential production of ethanol, butanol, acetone and

Volume = {{173}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates different scenarios for electric vehicle (EV)
   deployment in China and explores the implications thereof with regard to
   energy portfolio, economics and the environment. Specifically, we
   investigate how to better deliver the value of EVs by improving designs
   in the power system and charging strategies, given expected developments
   by 2030 in both the power system and EV penetration levels.
   The impact of EV charging is quantified by applying an integrated
   transportation-power system model on a set of scenarios which represent
   uncertainties in charging strategies. We find that deploying EVs
   essentially shifts the use of gasoline to coal-fired power generation in
   China, thus leading to more coal consumption and CO2 emissions of the
   power system. Economically, EVs outperform gasoline-powered vehicles in
   terms of average fueling costs. However, the impact of EVs in terms of
   CO2 emissions at the national level largely depends on the charging
   strategy. Specifically, controlled charging results in more CO2
   emissions associated with EVs than uncontrolled charging, as it tends to
   feed EVs with electricity produced by cheap yet low-efficiency coal
   power plants located in regions where coal prices are low. Still,
   compared with uncontrolled charging, controlled charging shows absolute
   advantages in: (1) mitigating the peak load arising from EV charging;
   (2) facilitating RES generation; and (3) reducing generation costs and
   EV charging costs. Hence, in light of this trade-off of controlled
   charging with the goals of energy security, economic efficiency and
   reducing environmental impacts, policy interventions in the Chinese
   power system should opt for controlled charging strategies in order to
   best realize the benefits of EVs. Accordingly, this paper proposes that
   increasing the use of cleaner forms of electricity generation, such as
   RES power and gas power, and establishing energy efficiency and CO2
   emission regulations in power dispatch are critical for China. Lastly,
   this work illustrates what the optimized charging profiles from the
   power system perspective look like for different regions. These results
   can inform Chinese policy makers in creating a better integration of the
   transportation and the power system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Himalayan water resources attract a rapidly growing number of
   hydroelectric power projects (HPP) to satisfy Asia's soaring energy
   demands. Yet HPP operating or planned in steep, glacier-fed mountain
   rivers face hazards of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) that can
   damage hydropower infrastructure, alter water and sediment yields, and
   compromise livelihoods downstream. Detailed appraisals of such GLOF
   hazards are limited to case studies, however, and a more comprehensive,
   systematic analysis remains elusive. To this end we estimate the
   regional exposure of 257 Himalayan HPP to GLOFs, using a flood-wave
   propagation model fed by Monte Carlo-derived outburst volumes of >2300
   glacial lakes. We interpret the spread of thus modeled peak discharges
   as a predictive uncertainty that arises mainly from outburst volumes and
   dam-breach rates that are difficult to assess before dams fail. With
   66\% of sampled HPP are on potential GLOF tracks, up to one third of
   these HPP could experience GLOF discharges well above local design
   floods, as hydropower development continues to seek higher sites closer
   to glacial lakes. We compute that this systematic push of HPP into
   headwaters effectively doubles the uncertainty about GLOF peak discharge
   in these locations. Peak discharges farther downstream, in contrast, are
   easier to predict because GLOF waves attenuate rapidly. Considering this
   systematic pattern of regional GLOF exposure might aid the site
   selection of future Himalayan HPP. Our method can augment, and help to
   regularly update, current hazard assessments, given that global warming
   is likely changing the number and size of Himalayan meltwater lakes.}},

Abstract = {{It is predicted that energy requirements in developing countries will
   increase global water consumption as a result of implementation of new
   power generation systems, and to population growth of the middle
   classes. Thus, it is anticipated that increased regional energy
   consumption will likely increase global water scarcity as a result of
   the consequent international energy trade. The degree of impact,
   however, depends on the degree of water scarcity in the energy-export
   regions. Therefore, the impact on global water scarcity by the
   international energy trade of Thailand was evaluated, using virtual
   water flow, and considering water scarcity. First, the amount of natural
   gas, crude oil, coal, and electricity imported and exported by each
   country was determined from energy and trading statistics. Concurrently,
   a database of water withdrawn per unit of energy production was built
   using commodity and water scarcity indices by country. Next, standard,
   scarcity-weighted, and region-based scarcity-weighted virtual water
   flows were calculated using a bottom-up approach. From this, the net
   virtual water import (NVWI) was determined to be 1,267 to 7,353 million
   cubic meters (m(3)), whereas the stress-weighted and region-based
   stress-weighted NVWIs were determined to be from -2 to 1,820, and -4 to
   3,696 million m(3), respectively, over the past 20 years. It was found
   that, although the amount of virtual water import for the power
   generation was significant, imported crude oil was the greatest
   contributor to global water scarcity. Finally, the implications of these
   results for policy to prevent global water scarcity are considered, with
   discussion of the usability and uncertainty, of the water scarcity
   index.}},

Title = {{Southern Africa's Water-Energy Nexus: Towards Regional Integration and

Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The Southern African Development Community's (SADC) water and energy
   sectors are under increasing pressure due to population growth and
   agricultural and industrial development. Climate change is also
   negatively impacting on the region's water and energy resources. As the
   majority of SADC's population lives in poverty, regional development and
   integration are underpinned by water and energy security as the
   watercourses in the region are transboundary in nature. This paper
   reviews the region's water and energy resources and recommends policies
   based on the water-energy nexus approach. This is achieved by reviewing
   literature on water and energy resources as well as policy issues. Water
   resources governance provides a strong case to create a water-energy
   nexus platform to support regional planning and integration as SADC
   countries share similar climatic and hydrological conditions. However,
   there has been a gap between water and energy sector planning in terms
   of policy alignment and technical convergence. These challenges hinder
   national policies on delivering economic and social development goals,
   as well as constraining the regional goal of greater integration.
   Regional objectives on sustainable energy and access to clean water for
   all can only be achieved through the recognition of the water-energy
   nexus, championed in an integrated and sustainable manner. A coordinated
   regional water-energy nexus approach stimulates economic growth,
   alleviates poverty and reduces high unemployment rates. The shared
   nature of water and energy resources requires far more transboundary
   water-energy nexus studies to be done in the context of regional
   integration and policy formulation.}},

   The effect and synergy of local air pollutants and GHG reduction
   achieved by hydropower development in Tibet vary significantly across

   synergy based on emission level of NPG was mainly influenced by net coal

Title = {{``Using marginal quality water for an energy crop in arid regions:
   Effect of salinity and boron distribution patterns{''}}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{142-152}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Marginal-quality water, such as recycled wastewater (RWW), is now
   commonly used for irrigation in regions with limited freshwater
   resources. However, the practice can pose a threat to soil conservation
   due to the high soluble salts content present in such water resources.
   Long-term sustainability of use therefore requires a sound understanding
   of the soil salinity distribution and appropriate selection of both crop
   and irrigation system. Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) has been proposed as an
   ideal candidate for biofuel production in arid and semi-arid regions
   under RWW irrigation, particularly on account of its high salt
   tolerance. The present study evaluates the evolution and distribution of
   soil salt and boron (B) as a potential constraint on the sustainability
   of a ``JCL-RWW{''} farming system on the island of Fuerteventura (Canary
   Islands-Spain) during five years of cultivation under surface drip
   irrigation (SDI) and sub-surface drip irrigation (SSDI). The results
   indicate that, under high evaporative demand conditions, SSDI does not
   appear to offer any advantage over SDI in terms of soil salt
   distribution. The results indicate that irrigation with RWW has
   increased boron concentrations by a factor of 7 (soil Typic
   Torrifluvents; TT) and 5 (soil Typic Haplocambids; TH), respectively, in
   relation to the control soils. Irrigation with RWW has also led to a
   rise in soil salinity reached values of 59 and 81 dS m(-1) for soil TT
   and TH, respectively. For soil TT and TH SAR, reached values of 56 and
   80 (meg L-1)(0.5), respectively as a result of irrigation with RWW.
   Although salinity does not seem to be a factor limiting crop production,
   irrigation with RWW can accelerate natural soil salinization processes
   in regions where desertification is of particular concern. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{China's 12th Five-Year Plan, released in March 2011, specifies water

   Energy and water resources are becoming the major bottlenecks
   restricting sustainable development in China. Energy and water are
   interconnected and complementary; however, macroenergy policies do not
   consider the impact on water resources, while water related policies do
   not consider the impact on energy consumption. In this paper, an
   energy-water evaluation methodology based on an input-output model was
   introduced, and correlation between energy and water supply sectors was
   established by this methodology. The correlation coefficients for the
   energy water nexus, allowing the water savings associated with energy
   saving policies in China to be estimated, particularly for key
   industrial sectors during the 12th Five-Year Plan period were provided.
   These results indicate that by achieving the energy saving targets in
   the end of the 12th Five-Year Plan, progress will also be made toward
   achieving the water use targets. It is believed that targets for the
   synergies between energy savings and water conservation should be
   improved. The effect of water conservation resulting from energy savings
   varies greatly in different sectors, and to maximize the synergies,
   energy and water conservation technologies should be promoted in key

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Estimating groundwater inflow into a tunnel before and
   during the excavation process is an important task to ensure the safety
   and schedule during the underground construction process.
   Case description: Here we report a case of the forecasting and
   prevention of water inrush at the Jinping II Hydropower Station
   diversion tunnel groups during the excavation process. The diversion
   tunnel groups are located in mountains and valleys, and with high water
   pressure head. Three forecasting methods are used to predict the total
   water inflow of the \#2 diversion tunnel. Furthermore, based on the
   accurate estimation of the water inrush around the tunnel working area,
   a theoretical method is presented to forecast the water inflow at the
   working area during the excavation process.
   Discussion and evaluation: The simulated results show that the total
   water flow is 1586.9, 1309.4 and 2070.2 m(3)/h using the Qshima method,
   Kostyakov method and Ochiai method, respectively. The Qshima method is
   the best one because it most closely matches the monitoring result.
   According to the huge water inflow into the \#2 diversion tunnel,
   reasonable drainage measures are arranged to prevent the potential
   disaster of water inrush. The groundwater pressure head can be
   determined using the water flow velocity from the advancing holes; then,
   the groundwater pressure head can be used to predict the possible water
   inflow. The simulated results show that the groundwater pressure head
   and water inflow re stable and relatively small around the region of the
   intact rock mass, but there is a sudden change around the fault region
   with a large water inflow and groundwater pressure head. Different
   countermeasures are adopted to prevent water inrush disasters during the
   tunnel excavation process.
   Conclusion: Reasonable forecasting the characteristic parameters of
   water inrush is very useful for the formation of prevention and
   mitigation schemes during the tunnel excavation process.}},

Abstract = {{The explicit tendency to increase the power generation from stochastic
   renewable resources forces to look for technological solutions of energy
   management and storage. In the recent years, the concept of
   power-to-gas, where the excess energy is converted into hydrogen and/or
   further methanized into renewable methane, is gaining high popularity
   among researchers. In this study, we assess the power to-renewable
   methane system as the potential technology for power grid balancing. For
   the assessment, a mathematical model has been developed that assists in
   understanding of whether a power-to renewable methane system can be
   developed in a region with specific installed and planned capacities of
   wind energy and biogas plants. Considering the varying amount of excess
   power available for H-2 production and the varying biogas quality, the
   aim of the model is to simulate the system to determine, if wind power
   generation meets the needs of biogas plants for storing the excess
   energy in the form of methane via the methanation process. For the case
   study, the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) have been
   selected, as the region is characterized by high dependence on fossil
   energy sources and electricity import. The results show that with the
   wind power produced in the region it would be possible to increase the
   average CH4 content in the methanized biogas by up to 48.4\%. Yet, even
   with a positive H-2 net production rate, not in all cases the maximum
   possible quality of the renewable methane would be achieved, as at
   moments the necessary amount of H-2 for methanation would not be readily
   available, and the reaction would not be possible. Thus, in the region,
   the wind power capacities would not meet the biogas plant capacities nor
   now, nor until 2020. For the system's development, two potential
   pathways are seen as possible for balancing the regions' power grid. (C)

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{There are strong interdependencies between water use in agriculture and
   energy consumption as water saving technologies can require increased
   pumping and pressurizing. The Chinese Government includes water
   efficiency improvement and carbon intensity reduction targets in the
   12th Five-Year Plan (5YP. 2011-2015), yet the links between energy use
   and irrigation modernization are not always addressed in policy targets.
   Here we build an original model of the energy embedded in water pumping
   for irrigated agriculture and its related processes. The model is based
   on the physical processes of irrigation schemes and the implication of
   technological developments, comprising all processes from extraction and
   conveyance of water to its application in the field. The model uses data
   from government sources to assess policy targets for deployment of
   irrigation technologies, which aim to reduce water application and
   contribute to adaptation of Chinese agriculture to climate change. The
   consequences of policy targets involve co-beneficial outcomes that
   achieve water and energy savings, or trade-offs in which reduced water
   application leads to increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We
   analyze irrigation efficiency and energy use in four significant
   provinces and nationally, using scenarios based on the targets of the
   12th 5YP. At the national scale, we find that expansion of sprinklers
   and micro-irrigation as outlined in the 5YP would increase GHG emissions
   from agricultural water use, however, emissions decrease in those
   provinces with predominant groundwater use and planned expansion of
   low-pressure pipes. We show that the most costly technologies relate to
   trade-offs, while co-benefits are generally achieved with less expensive
   technologies. The investment cost per area of irrigation technology
   expansion does not greatly affect the outcome in terms of water, but in
   terms of energy the most expensive technologies are more
   energy-intensive and produce more emissions. The results show that water
   supply configuration (proportion of surface to groundwater) largely
   determines the potential energy savings from reductions in water
   application. The paper examines the importance of fertigation and
   highlights briefly some policy implications.}},

Abstract = {{Damming rivers to construct hydroelectric reservoirs results in a series
   of impacts on the biogeochemical Hg cycle. For example, modifying the
   hydrodynamics of a natural watercourse can result in the suspension and
   transport of Hg deposits in the water column, which represents an
   exposure risk for biota. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   influences of seasonality on the dispersion of total Hg in the
   Hydroelectric Power Plant (HPP)-Samuel Reservoir (Porto Velho/Brazil).
   Sampling campaigns were performed during the three following
   hydrological periods characteristic of the region: low (Oct/2011),
   ebbing (May/2012), and high (Feb/2013) water. Sediment profiles,
   suspended particulate matter (SPM), and aquatic macrophytes (Eicchornia
   crassipes and Oryza spp.) were collected, and their Hg concentrations
   and isotopic and elemental C and N signatures were determined. The
   drainage basin significantly influenced the SPM compositions during all
   the periods, with a small autochthonous influence from the reservoir
   during the low water. The highest SPM Hg concentrations inside the
   reservoir were observed during the high water period, suggesting that
   the hydrodynamics of this environment favor the suspension of fine SPM,
   which has a higher Hg adsorption capacity. The Hg concentrations in the
   sediment profiles were ten times lower than those in the SPM, indicating
   that large particles with low Hg concentrations were deposited to form
   the bottom sediment. Hg concentrations were higher in aquatic macrophyte
   roots than in their leaves and appeared to contribute to the formation
   of SPM during the low water period. In this environment, Hg transport
   mainly occurs in SPM from the Jamari River drainage basin, which is the
   primary source of Hg in this environment.}},

Volume = {{101}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Due to the lack of energy storage in the new hydropower plants in the
   Amazon region, Brazil will require thermoelectric power plants to
   generate electricity during the dry period (May October). Biomass based
   electricity generation, especially eucalyptus trees, can be used to
   replace the expensive liquefied natural gas infrastructure required to
   generate electricity during the dry seasons and emergency generation
   during dry years in Brazil. This article presents a new electricity
   generation scheme called ``Energy Crop Storage{''}. In this scheme,
   biomass is grown and stored in eucalyptus plantations in order to match
   the supply of energy to its demand. For example, during wet years in
   Brazil, when biomass plants operate at 50\% capacity, the eucalyptus
   trees are allowed to continue growing. During dry years, the biomass
   stored is used more intensively as biomass generation raises to 90\% of
   its capacity. It was concluded that natural gas is a high risk
   investment in Brazil because, if there are several consecutive wet
   years, the expensive infrastructure dedicated to natural gas based
   electricity generation will remain on standby. Biomass plantations, on
   the other hand, are a more reliable investment as the biomass is stored
   when the biomass demand is lower. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Substantial virtual water concurrent electricity is transferred among

   investigate the virtual water network within China's electric power

   water flows from the power generators to the power consumers and
   analyzing the tendency of the track results, (2) identifying the
   important grids that largely influence both the magnitude and diversity
   of the VWNCEPS, and (3) evaluating the overall performance of the
   VWNCEPS. Additionally, a new indicator is proposed that incorporates the
   concept of the water stress index (WSI) to measure the impact of the
   VWNCEPS on national water stress mitigation. The results show that
   during 2007-2012, the northern and central grids were always the most

   Furthermore, the input-oriented impacts of the six grids are similar,

   the different grids. Regarding the overall performance, the VWNCEPS
   exhibits a high level of system efficiency, whereas its flexibility is
   relatively low. Moreover, the VWNCEPS has a rapidly increasing positive
   effect on national water stress mitigation in China during 2007-2012,

Abstract = {{South Asian countries face mounting challenges in meeting the growing
   demand for food, water, and energy for a rapidly growing population.
   Countries have provided policy support to increase cereal production,
   including providing incentives by subsidizing water and energy and
   guaranteeing rice and wheat prices. While such incentives have increased
   cereal production, they have also increased the demand for water and
   energy, led to degradation of the resource base, and contributed to an
   increase in water-related disease. Despite the inherent interconnections
   between food, water, and energy production, agencies often work in a
   fragmented and isolated way. Poor sectoral coordination and
   institutional fragmentation have triggered an unsustainable use of
   resources and threatened the long-term sustainability of food, water,
   and energy security in the region, and also posed challenges to
   achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG5). Free water and
   subsidized electricity have not only encouraged overexploitation of
   resources, they have also led to under-investment in water and
   energy-saving technologies and approaches and hindered crop
   diversification and broad-based agricultural growth in line with the
   comparative advantages. Greater policy coherence among the three sectors
   is critical for decoupling increased food production from water and
   energy intensity and moving to a sustainable and efficient use of
   resources. The nexus approach can enhance understanding of the
   interconnectedness of the sectors and strengthen coordination among
   them. But it requires a major shift in the decision-making process
   towards taking a holistic view and developing institutional mechanisms
   to coordinate the actions of diverse actors and strengthen
   complementarities and synergies among the three sectors. A framework is
   suggested for cross-sectoral coordination and managing the nexus

Title = {{Shading greenhouses to improve the microclimate, energy and water saving
   in hot regions: A review}},

Abstract = {{Shading greenhouse is an effective method to achieve a suitable
   environment for crop growth and to enhance crop productivity and quality
   in hot and sunny regions. This article reviews common shading methods
   used for greenhouses in summer; their cooling effects on greenhouse air
   were explored to determine the optimum shading technique for arid
   regions. Effects of these methods on the overall microclimate as well as
   the distribution of the microclimatic parameters in greenhouses were
   discussed. The survey revealed that combining a shading method (e.g.,
   whitewash or shade netting) with ventilation and/or evaporative cooling
   showed a significant effect on improving overall microclimate as well as
   the distribution of microclimatic parameters. This consequently reduces
   the energy and water consumptions and increases the crop productivity
   and its quality. In sunny regions, incorporating shading with a cooling
   method is able to maintain greenhouse air temperature at 5-10 degrees C
   lower than the outside temperature, increases the relative humidity by
   approximately 15-20\% and decreases the transmitted solar radiation by
   30-50\% compared to a greenhouse without shading. In cold regions,
   shading materials act as insulators; significantly reduce heat loss from
   greenhouses at night. Thus, greenhouse air temperature can be maintained
   at 5 degrees C higher than outside with saving approximately 15-20\% of
   the energy used for heating. The information in this review would be
   useful for farmers, researchers and greenhouse designers to select the
   suitable cooling or heating strategy for greenhouses. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A carbon and nitrogen coupled dynamic vegetation ecosystem model
   (CLASS-CTEMN+) was used to assess the effects of nitrogen controls on
   simulated carbon, water and energy exchanges in a range of vegetation
   ecosystems. Standardized meteorological forcing data and eddy covariance
   flux measurements of carbon, water and energy from 32 FLUXNET sites
   covering eight major plant functional types (PFTs) across North America
   were used in the analysis. Two versions of the model, a carbon and
   nitrogen (C-N) coupled version and carbon (C) only version, were
   employed. Simulated diurnal, daily, seasonal and annual values of gross
   ecosystem productivity (GEE), ecosystem respiration (Re), net ecosystem
   productivity (NEP), net radiation (Rn), sensible heat flux (H), latent
   heat flux (LE) and vegetation biomass and soil carbon stocks were
   compared with available measured values to evaluate the model's
   performance in each PFT.
   The C-N version of the model simulated annual mean NEP for all sites was
   211 g C m(-2) yr(-1), compared to 174 g C m(-2) yr(-1) from observation
   and 253 g C m(-2) yr(-1) by the C version, respectively. Overall, the
   inclusion of a nitrogen cycle with the carbon cycle in the model
   resulted in better accuracy scores (e.g., reduced RMSE by 0.31, 0.10 and
   0.09 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the C-N version relative to the C version, for
   GEP, Re and NEP, respectively) when compared with observations.
   Simulated Rn, H and LE were usually improved with the inclusion of a
   nitrogen cycle, but the changes were not always statistically
   significant at the site level as they were with carbon exchanges.
   Results indicated the simulated N limitation effects varied among PFTs,
   but were strongest for boreal forests during the early-growing season.
   Evaluation of N deposition impacts on GEP, NEP and biomass pools showed
   considerable variability between and within forest types due to
   non-linearity of N effects and spatial heterogeneity of C and N cycle
   interactions. Inclusion of the N cycle in the model will help in its
   application at regional and global scales to evaluate N availability
   impacts on the C cycle in terrestrial ecosystems and to determine N
   cycle feedbacks on Earth's climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   for a Wind Power Accommodation Scenario}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Wind power generation reduces our reliance on fossil fuels and can thus
   reduce environmental pollution. However, rapid wind power development
   has caused various issues related to power grid restructuring. A high
   proportion of the generating capacity of northeast China is based on
   combined heat and power (CHP), whose inflexible response to the peak
   regulation of power grids hinders the ability to accommodate wind power;
   thus, wind power curtailment is prevalent. Electric boilers can directly
   consume the excess wind power to supply heat during low load periods and
   thus mitigate the heat supply stress of CHP units. Therefore, electric
   boilers improve the power grid's ability to accommodate additional wind
   power. From a regional power grid perspective, this paper discussed the
   feasibility of such a strategy for increasing the ability to accommodate
   wind power during the heat supply season. This paper analysed the
   optimum electric boiler capacity configuration of a regional power grid
   based on various constraint conditions, such as the heat-power balance,
   with the objective of maximising the associated social benefits. Using
   the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei power grid as an example, the optimum electric
   boiler capacity of the studied power grid is approximately 1100 MW.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to document the structure of the fish
   assemblages found in the aquatic environments affected by the Coaracy
   Nunes hydroelectric reservoir in Ferreira-Gomes, Amapa (Brazil) and the
   principal factors that determine this structure. In order to do this,
   standardized samples were collected of the fauna and the environmental
   parameters in the four principal sectors of the reservoir (upstream, the
   reservoir, the lake, and downstream). Fish species richness, abundance,
   and biomass were estimated for each sector. The abundance data were
   analyzed using null models of co-occurrence. A multivariate BIO-ENV
   analysis was used to examine the relationship between biological and
   environmental factors. The relationship between species richness and
   biomass of both prey and predator species was analyzed to determine
   whether predation was affecting community structure. Size spectrum
   analysis was conducted to verify whether fishing has influenced
   community structure. The results indicated contrasting seasonal patterns
   of deterministic processes in the downstream and lake sectors,
   suggesting that competition or abiotic factors may play a role in
   community structure. Stochastic patterns were recorded in the other
   sectors. Environmental factors, such as water transparency and depth,
   and the reservoir level were also closely related to the relative
   abundance of species in the communities. The relationship between the
   species richness and the biomass of predators and prey indicated that
   predation was an important determinant of community structure, which was
   interrupted by selective fishing. Despite the stochastic nature of most
   processes, deterministic factors were fundamental to the structure of
   the assemblages found in the downstream and lake sectors.}},

Abstract = {{Rockbursts were frequently encountered during the construction of deep
   tunnels at the Jinping II hydropower station, Southwest China.
   Investigations of the possibility of rockbursts during tunnel boring
   machine (TBM) and drilling and blasting (D\&B) advancement are necessary
   to guide the construction of tunnels and to protect personnel and TBM
   equipment from strainburst-related accidents. A real-time, movable
   microseismic monitoring system was installed to forecast strainburst
   locations ahead of the tunnel faces. The spatiotemporal distribution
   evolution of microseismic events prior to and during strainbursts was
   recorded and analysed. The concentration of microseismic events prior to
   the occurrence of strainbursts was found to be a significant precursor
   to strainbursts in deep rock tunnelling. During a 2-year microseismic
   investigation of strainbursts in the deep tunnels at the Jinping II
   hydropower station, a total of 2240 strainburst location forecasts were
   issued, with 63 \% correctly forecasting the locations of strainbursts.
   The successful forecasting of strainburst locations proved that
   microseismic monitoring is essential for the assessment and mitigation
   of strainburst hazards, and can be used to minimise damage to equipment
   and personnel. The results of the current study may be valuable for the
   construction management and safety assessment of similar underground

   Aims: To understand the role of both climate and geographical location
   on variation in tree species composition in a region characterised by an
   abrupt transition from wet forests to semi-arid thorn-woodlands. To test
   whether a regional classification of forests according to elevation

   Methods: We submitted 14,094 tree species occurrence records and 31
   geo-climatic variables prepared for 57 sites in eastern Bahia, Brazil,
   to multivariate and regression analyses and variance partitioning.
   Results: Climate and space were both significantly (P <= 0.05)
   contributing to explaining floristic variations. Actual
   evapotranspiration, duration of water deficit, and minimum temperature
   of coldest month were the main predictors. Floristic differences were
   significant except when comparing evergreen lower plains and upper

Abstract = {{Coal is China's most important primary energy source, and is supporting
   the rapid economic growth going on there. However, the reverse
   geographical distribution of coal production and consumption results in
   a high cost of coal transportation and low efficiency of coal
   utilization. To ease the pressure on coal transportation, and to
   mitigate pollution in eastern coastal regions, China has kicked off a
   strategic west east transfer of energy industries that requires the
   movement of coal power projects to the arid northwest regions. Under
   this strategic framework, the regulation is focused on ``clean
   production{''}, ``consumption reduction{''} and ``reuse{''}, rather than
   conservation and protection of water resources. This study found that
   the northwest areas are unable to accommodate fully the planned scale of
   coal-fired power industry. Moreover, the subsidiary chemical industry,
   even if the scale of electric power development is determined according
   to the need for coal production, is problematic because the current
   water demand for the coal industry has exceeded ``allowed water
   withdrawal{''}. Given limited water saving potential and the huge
   demand-and-supply gap, it is also unrealistic to balance water demand by
   combination of water conservation in the power industry and water right
   diversion from agriculture. This study on the synergies between energy
   and water is urgently needed, in order to provide scientific and
   technological support for laying out new energy industries. A critical
   change should involve conciliation of conflicting policies or plans
   before implementation begins. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   Background: Recent technological disasters with severe environmental
   impact are attributed to human factors and safety culture causes. One of
   the most populous and environmentally sensitive regions in the world,
   the (Persian) Gulf, is on the confluence of an exponentially growing
   number of two industriesnuclear power and seawater desalination

Abstract = {{Power grid interconnection has gained attention in Northeast Asia (NEA)
   as a means to build an economically efficient power system and to
   effectively utilize renewable energy, such as wind and solar resources
   in the Gobi Desert and hydro resources in Eastern Russia.
   In order to quantify the potential economic and environmental benefits
   from connecting power grids and developing renewables in NEA, we build
   an NEA-wide multi-region power system model using linear programming
   techniques. Our analysis considers power system characteristics, such as
   the seasonal and daily electric load curves of the various NEA
   economies.
   Compared to a ``no grid extension{''} scenario, increased access to
   renewables contributes significantly to emissions reductions and fuel
   cost savings. However, the results imply modest benefits in lowering
   total cost because of the large initial investments needed in developing
   the renewables and the transmission lines. These limited total cost
   savings are likely to pose an implementation challenge for NEA grid
   interconnections. Our results also suggest that grid interconnections
   become more economically attractive in higher fuel price or lower
   initial cost situations. The relevant planning organizations should
   carefully consider the initial cost and future fuel price trends when
   considering how to interconnect power girds in an economical manner. (C)

Abstract = {{Previous studies agree that cooperation among participants is critical

   quantitatively illustrated how participants benefit from cooperation.
   Based on partnering and cooperative game theories, the degree of
   willingness to cooperate (DWC) model has been used in this study to
   reflect the interactions among participants through dynamic simulation.
   With the support of data collected from a field survey, the outcomes of
   DWC model simulation have been tested, confirming that DWCs have
   significantly positive influences on cooperation gains, and incentives
   are effective in improving participants' rewards. Application of the DWC
   model then reveals the cooperation status of hydropower developments in

   interorganizational cooperation in project delivery. This study advances
   the knowledge area of multiorganizational dynamics during project
   delivery by building interdisciplinary linkage between partnering theory
   and cooperative game theory, which provides a structure to
   quantitatively unfold the cause-effect relationships between DWCs,
   incentives, and participants' rewards. This research also reveals the
   mutual goals and different priorities of project participants and
   answers questions on how coalitions can be formed and how cooperation

Abstract = {{Climate change is expected to cause alterations of streamflow regimes in
   the Alpine region, with possible relevant consequences for several
   socio-economic sectors including hydropower production. The impact of
   climate change on water resources and hydropower production is evaluated
   with reference to the Noce catchment, which is located in the
   Southeastern Alps, Italy. Projected changes of precipitation and
   temperature, derived from an ensemble of 4 climate model (CM) runs for
   the period 2040-2070 under the SRES A1B emission scenario, have been
   downscaled and bias corrected before using them as climatic forcing in a
   hydrological model. Projections indicate an increase of the mean
   temperature of the catchment in the range 2-4 K, depending on the
   climate model used. Projections of precipitation indicate an increase of
   annual precipitation in the range between 2\% and 6\% with larger
   changes in winter and autumn. Hydrological simulations show an increase
   of water yield during the period 2040-2070 with respect to 1970-2000.
   Furthermore,.a transition from glacio-nival to nival regime is projected
   for the catchment. Hydrological regime is expected to change as a
   consequence of less winter precipitation falling as snow and anticipated
   melting in spring, with the runoff peak decreasing in intensity and
   anticipating from July to June. Changes in water availability reflect in
   the Technical Hydropower Potential (THP) of the catchment, with larger
   changes projected for the hydropower plants located at the highest
   altitudes. Finally, the impacts on THP of water use policies such as the
   introduction of prescriptions for minimum ecological flow (MEF) have
   been analyzed. Simulations indicate that in the lower part of the
   catchment reduction of the hydropower production due to MEF releases
   from the storage reservoirs counterbalances the benefits associated to
   the projected increases of inflows as foreseen by simulations driven
   only by climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The bulk hydropower transmission with one-fourth of its total capacity
   in China via UHVDC (ultra-high voltage direct current) lines brings a
   new challenge for receiving power grids. There is an urgent need for
   coordinated operations about the receiving regional power grids which
   operate outside energy and their own large plants linked in the AC/DC
   network. A great operating concern is how to shave peak loads from
   subordinate provincial power grids using their load differences and
   various energy source characteristics. The East China Grid, a main
   receiver of Chinese hydropower transmission and the largest regional
   power grid, is taken as the example. An integrated framework for
   coordinating large-scale UHVDC hydropower and conventional hydro
   energies for power grid peak operation is presented. It divides the
   original problem into several subproblems according to the types of
   energy sources. An EPSA (exterior point search algorithm), a heuristic
   method, and a multi-step optimization algorithm are developed to
   respectively solve the UHVDC hydropower subproblem, the pumped-storage
   subproblem, and the conventional hydropower subproblem. These algorithms
   are integrated into an iterative solution procedure between all
   subproblems, wherein the EPSA is also applied to allocate power
   generation among provincial power grids. The proposed method is
   effective and efficient for coordinating large-scale UHVDC hydropower
   with conventional hydro energies and for fully responding to different
   peak loads among provinces, as demonstrated in two case studies. (C)

Abstract = {{The hydropower reservoirs, considered as a green source of energy, are
   now found to emit significant quantities of greenhouse gas (GHG) to the
   atmosphere. This article attempts to predict the vulnerability of Tehri
   reservoir, India to GHG emissions using the GHG risk assessment tool
   (GRAT). The GRAT is verified with experimental GHG fluxes. The annual
   mean CO2 fluxes from diffusion, bubbling, and degassing were 425.93 +/-
   122.50, 4.81 +/- 1.33, and 7.01 +/- 2.77 mg m(-2)d(-1), whereas CH4
   fluxes were 23.11 +/- 7.08, 4.79 +/- 1.08, and 7.41 +/- 4.50 mg
   m(-2)d(-1), respectively, during 2011-12. The model found that Tehri
   reservoir emitted higher CO2 and CH4 (i.e., 790 mg m(-2)d(-1) and 64 mg
   m(-2)d(-1), respectively) in 2011, which came within vulnerability range
   causing more climate change impact. By the year 2015, it would scale
   down to medium risks necessitating no further assessment of GHG.
   Significant difference between predicted and experimental GHG emission
   are assessed, which may be due to insufficient data, spatial and
   temporal variations, decomposition of flooded biomass, limitation of
   GRAT model, and inadequate methodology. The study reveals that GHG
   emission from Tehri reservoir is less than predicted by the GRAT.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of growing world demand for electricity, combined with
   clearly visible necessity of rational use and supplementation of fossil
   fuels, the global electric power system faces new challenges. Intensive
   development of the electrical energy production from renewable sources
   causes the necessity to include them in the global electricity
   production. This challenge is connected with applying of completely new
   ideas of comprehension and functioning of the electrical power
   engineering system. Computer technologies implemented in power
   engineering are trying to meet new challenges. These technologies allow
   to control the distributed generation system and adapt its state for the
   current and forecasted production of electricity. A holistic approach to
   the problem of the modern production of electricity has led to the
   development of Smart Grids. In the article the current state and
   prospects of the Smart Grid technology development in Poland as a part
   of global electric power system were presented. The current assessment
   was based on statistics of the projects, the sources of their financing
   and the Smart Grid technology applications. This analysis was compared
   with selected examples of the situation in other European countries. The
   prospects for the development of Smart Grid technology in Poland are
   shown in terms of geographical, legal and economic aspects. The special
   attention was paid to the relations between opening for implementing the
   new technology, renewable energy sources and behaviour of the electric
   power industry. In the summary, the authors focused on the presentation
   of elements, that stimulate the development of the Smart Grid.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the electricity used in Brazil comes from hydroelectric plants,
   mainly due to the great availability of its water resources. However,
   the construction of these plants denotes serious problems related to
   migration of native fish and the genetic conservation of stocks. Current
   study evaluates two wild population of Leporinus elongatus (piapara)
   located downstream (Population A - PopA) and upstream (Population B -
   PopB) of the Cachoeira Branca before the construction of the Sao
   Domingos hydroelectric plant (HPP) in the Mato Grosso do Sul State,
   Brazil. Thirty samples from caudal fins were collected and analyzed for
   each population. Eighty-nine fragments, including 72 polymorphic ones
   (80.9\%), were analyzed. Low fragments (less than 0.100) in both
   populations (PopA = 2 and PopB = 3) were identified. Nine fixed
   fragments (frequency 1.000) (PopA = 3 and PopB = 6), and four exclusive
   fragments (PopA = 3 and PopB = 1) were also reported. The genetic
   variability within populations, calculated by Shannon Index and by
   percentage of polymorphic fragments, indicated high rates of
   intra-population variability (PopA = 0.309 and 61.80\% and PopB = 0.392
   and 71.90\%, respectively). Genetic distance and identity rates (0.089
   and 0.915, respectively) were different between populations, whilst
   AMOVA showed that most variations lie within the populations and not
   between them. Fst and Nm rates showed moderate genetic differentiation
   with low numbers of migrants. Results reveal populations with high
   intra-population genetic variability and genetic differentiation, with
   low gene flow. The passage ladders of Sao Domingos HPP should control
   fish transposition to preserve genetic variability.}},

   The second part is related to the determination of extreme maximum peak

   quantiles. The original approach in the first part lies in combining the
   probabilistic theory of Poisson's process, regional analysis and the
   integration of particular phenomena linked to orographic features. The
   rivers studied in Albania include the Vjosa, which flows through the
   southern part of the country. It has a total length of 272 km, 80 km of
   which are in Greece. In this geographical area we have 13 rainfall
   stations at our disposal (not counting the numerous stations available
   nearby) and seven discharge measurement stations with data covering the
   period 1951-1992. The regional analysis of rainfall across this
   catchment area revealed a homogeneous precipitation regime. The rainfall
   -runoff probabilistic correlation analyses confirmed the relations from
   the PARDES model and revealed saturation at a return period of 4 years.}},

   analyzes the technical and management causes for grid losses, proposes
   technical measures to reasonably manage the economic operation of

   power grid, and management measures to strengthen the calculation of
   grid loss theoretically and management over users, attempting to provide
   references to reduce power loss while transmitting the same power and
   improve the economic operation of regional power grid.
   Power system is an energy production and consumption system consisting
   of power generation, transmission, substation, distribution and
   consumption. Grid enterprises transmit power from power plants to all
   types of users by series of processes and obtain the price difference of
   purchasing and selling power as profit. Take the electricity supply of a
   prefecture-level city 8 billion kWh as example. A power loss rate of 6\%
   means an annual power loss of 480 million kWh; and every 0.1\% reduction
   of power loss would help save 8 million kWh, bringing another 5.2
   million yuan of profits on the basis of the average electricity price
   0.65 yuan / kWh in Liaoning Power Grid.
   Therefore, under the overall environment of increasing depletion of
   traditional energy sources and advocating of energy conservation,
   managers of grid enterprises begin to pay more attention to power loss
   management, actively implement better management over power loss,
   explore effective measures to improve scientific management in grid
   enterprises. This paper mainly attempts to analyze factors leading to
   power loss and measures to reduce power loss, so as to realize economic
   operation of power grid on the basis of meeting power need and ensuring
   the safe operation of grid and power quality}},

Abstract = {{Climate changes are likely to be significantly affected by

   this study, a coupled GHG Risk Assessment Tool (GRAT) and Soil Water
   Assessment Tool (SWAT) are used to predict the GHG risk of Koteshwar
   reservoirs located in Uttarakhand, India. Before running the GRAT model,
   SWAT model was used to simulate the runoffs (one of the major input of
   GRAT). The model was calibrated (2004-09) and validated (2010-13) at
   Uttarkashi station using monthly discharge data. The model performance
   was checked by R-2, NSE, RSR, and p-value as 0.785, 0.60, 0.63, and
   0.04, respectively, during calibration and 0.790, 0.66, 0.57, and 0.06

   time step. Further, GRAT model is also applied and the results show that
   Koteshwar reservoir is found to be under high risk of CO2 (CO2 > 645mg
   m(-2) d(-1)) and medium risk of CH4 (CH4 < 45mg m(-2) d(-1)) till 2023.
   Subsequently, the GHG risk is minimized after passage of time over
   100years. These models may be used by the policy-makers to know the
   potential of GHG and its vulnerability to the reservoirs after the

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare some biological materials in respect to the water
   and tissue equivalence properties for photon, electron, proton and alpha
   particle interactions as means of the effective atomic number (Z(eff))
   and electron density (N-e).Methods: A Z-wise interpolation procedure has
   been adopted for calculation of Z(eff) using the mass attenuation
   coefficients for photons and the mass stopping powers for charged
   particles.Results: At relatively low energies (100keV-3MeV), Z(eff) and
   N-e for photons and electrons were found to be constant while they vary
   much more for protons and alpha particles. In contrast, Z(eff) and N-e
   for protons and alpha particles were found to be constant after 3MeV
   whereas for photons and electrons they were found to increase with the
   increasing energy. Also, muscle eq. liquid (with sucrose) have Z(eff)
   and N-e values close to the Muscle Skeletal (ICRP) and Muscle Striated
   (ICRU) within low relative differences below 9\%. Muscle eq. liquid
   (without sucrose) have Z(eff) and N-e values close to the Muscle
   Skeletal (ICRP) and Muscle Striated (ICRU) with difference below

Abstract = {{The Danba Hydropower Project, located in Danba County, Sichuan Province,
   China, was planned to be constructed on a thick fluvial deposit
   foundation, with a maximum depth of the deposits up to 133 m. The loose
   deposits are characteristic of complex origin, composition,
   distribution, and mechanical and hydraulic properties. The controls of
   seepage flow and settlement in the foundation become two key
   technological issues for construction of the dam. In this study, the
   coupled processes between groundwater flow and deformation were modelled
   with the finite element method for performance assessment of the seepage
   control system and the foundation treatments. The saturated flow process
   was formulated with an adaptive variational inequality formulation of
   Signorini's condition, which eliminates the singularity of the seepage
   points and the resultant mesh dependency. The deformation response of
   the loose deposits was described using the Duncan-Chang non-linear
   elastic E-B model, together with the Goodman interfacial elements for
   simulation of the soil-structure interactions. The stress-dependent
   variations in the permeability of the loose deposits were considered on
   the basis of the Kozeny-Carman's model. The numerical results indicate
   that the designed seepage-control structures are effective and the
   settlement is limited within 20 cm using proper foundation treatments.}},

Abstract = {{A model of high-penetration micro-hydropower system with no storage is
   presented in this paper. This technology is designed in order to reduce
   the diesel fuel consumption and cost of electricity supply in a resort
   island located in the South China Sea. The optimal hydropower generation
   for this system depends on the available stream flow at the potential
   sites. At low stream flow, both the micro-hydropower system and the
   currently installed diesel generators are required to feed the load.
   However, when the hydropower generation exceeds the load demand, the
   diesel generator is shut down. Meanwhile, the system frequency is
   controlled by a secondary load bank that absorbs the hydropower which
   exceeds the consumer demand. This paper also presents a discrete
   frequency control system using proportional-derivative (PD) controller.
   The controller is employed in order to manipulate the system frequency
   by controlling the secondary load system. The simulation results
   indicate that a variety of load conditions can be satisfactorily
   controlled by the PD controller. Hence, this particular type of
   controller is suitable to be implemented in micro-grid systems for
   remote areas that require low cost and easy-to-maintain controllers.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the largest active terrestrial carbon
   reservoir, which behaves both as a sink and source for atmospheric
   carbon. The same is maximum in the forest soil of Abies pindrow (128 t

   potential is also found to be maximum in Alpine forest soil (i.e., 1.84)
   in Abies pindrow and minimum in the chir (i.e., 1.00) in P. Roxburghii.
   This indicates that alpine forest soil can hold nearly two times more
   SOC than chir and hence it behaves as a CO2 sink. The overall average
   content of SOC and carbon dioxide equivalent under all land use was
   estimated at 91.29 t ha(-1) and 334.11 t ha(-1), respectively. The
   objective of this study is to estimate the spatial variability of SOC
   stocks in the catchment of both the Tehri and Koteshwar hydroelectric

   geostatistical methods. The study provides an estimation for the amount
   of carbon reaching to the reservoir through various sources, where it

Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{During August- September 2012, we sampled six hydropower reservoirs in
   southeastern United States for CO2 and CH4 emissions via three pathways:
   diffusive emissions from water surface; ebullition in the water column;
   and losses from dam tailwaters during power generation. Estimates of
   average areal emission rates of CO2 attributable to the six reservoirs (
   i. e., reservoir plus tailwater emissions) ranged from 994 to 2760 mg
   center dot m-2 center dot day - 1, which is low to moderate compared to
   CO2 emissions rates reported for tropical hydropower reservoirs and
   boreal ponds and lakes, and similar to rates reported for other
   temperate reservoirs. Similar average rates for CH4 were also relatively
   low, ranging from 6 to 187 mg center dot m - 2 center dot day-1. On a
   whole- reservoir basis, estimates of total emissions of CO2 ranged 10-
   fold, from 42,740 kg per day for Fontana to 501,151 kg per day for
   Guntersville, and total emissions of CH4 ranged over 30- fold, from 251
   kg per day for Fontana to 9153 kg per day for Allatoona. Emissions
   through the tailwater pathway varied among reservoirs, comprising from
   19\% to 65\% of total CO2 emissions and 0\% to 84\% of CH4 emissions,
   depending on the reservoir. Emission rates were significantly correlated
   with several reservoir morphological and water quality characteristics,
   including metrics related to vertical stratification ( e. g., minimum
   water column temperature and maximum dissolved oxygen) and reservoir
   productivity ( e. g., water transparency and chlorophyll a

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine the energy consumption and the
   relationship between energy input and yield for drip-irrigated potato
   under Middle Anatolian climatic conditions in Konya, Turkey. Also, the
   specific amount of energy consumed in irrigation was determined for both
   surface water and ground water sources. The experiment was carried out
   during the growing periods of 2008 and 2009. The results showed that
   total energy inputs were 63,222 MJha(-1). About 62\% of the total energy
   inputs in potato production were found to be indirect energy (seeds,
   fertilizers, chemicals, machinery, and polyethylene pipe) and 38\% was
   direct energy (human labor, electricity, and diesel). Irrigation
   consumed the most energy, accounting for 43.8\% of total energy inputs.
   Amongst the direct energy inputs, irrigation had the maximum share of
   direct energy viz. 15,473 MJha(-1), which was almost 65\% of direct
   energy input. Specific energy consumption of a drip irrigation system
   that takes water from surface and ground water sources was found to be

   water sources, and the difference between those systems was about 37\%.

Abstract = {{Electric power industry is a key to achieve the low-carbon social and
   economic development. Distributed generation (DG) has great potential in
   the development of low-carbon power grid because of its non-polluting
   property and large reserves. Therefore, it is of great importance to
   have a comprehensive investigation on low-carbon impact of DG on power
   grids. In this paper, regional power grids are focused as they are
   crucial supporters of regional economic and social activities and the
   primary undertakers of low-carbon development. Specifically, first, the
   carbon dioxide emission coefficient and energy consumption of DG are
   evaluated from the aspect of its life cycle. Then, the wind farm and
   photovoltaic power station are compared in terms of carbon dioxide
   emissions and energy consumption, indicated that wind power is superior
   in reducing the carbon dioxide emissions. Finally, the carbon intensity
   of provincial power grid is evaluated by grey prediction model with
   historical data such as electricity consumption, gross domestic product
   (GDP), carbon dioxide emission coefficient. Taking Jiangxi provincial
   power grid as the example, the results demonstrate that the proposed
   prediction method is of high accuracy and the integration of DGs can
   effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions and carbon intensity, thus,
   DG should be widely integrated into provincial power grids. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Due to the stark reality of regional development disparities, China has
   to confront the sustainable development challenges brought about by
   social inequality. To compensate for these regional differences in
   natural resource endowments, effective investment in power grid
   infrastructure (PGI) and improvement of power grids might prove helpful
   in reducing poverty and narrowing the development gap. This paper
   constructs a ``Peripheral Degree Index{''} (PDI) of power grid to
   measure the effective distance between electricity delivering areas and
   receiving regions. Moreover we discuss how to efficiently locate the
   investment in PGI and optimize the allocation of limited financial
   resources. The results show investment in PGI has higher marginal
   benefit for less developed provinces in energy delivering regions; and
   more importantly, improvement of the grid infrastructure in central
   areas which connect energy receiving and delivering regions.
   Particularly, to improve the grid facilities in the central areas could
   reduce electricity transmission cost and help to alleviate the railway
   strain for coal transportation. Therefore, our findings suggest that it
   is more advisable to locate the investment of power grid infrastructure
   in the central provinces that are located at strategic conjunctions of
   the nationwide power grid, including Shanxi, Henan, Hubei and Hebei. (C)

Title = {{Quantification of the water, energy and carbon footprints of wastewater
   treatment plants in China considering a water-energy nexus perspective}},

Abstract = {{Water and energy are closely connected and both are very important for
   human development. Waste-water treatment plants (WWTPs) are central to
   water-energy interactions as they consume energy to remove pollutants
   and thus reduce the human gray water footprint on the natural water
   environment. In this work, we quantified energy consumption in 9
   different WWTPs in south China, with different treatment processes,
   objects, and capacities. The energy intensity in most of these WWTPs is
   in the range of 0.4-0.5 kWh/m(3) in 2014. Footprint methodologies were
   used in this paper to provide insight into the environmental changes
   that result from VVWTPs. A new indicator ``gray water footprint
   reduction{''} is proposed based on the notion of gray water footprint to
   better assess the role of WWTPs in reducing human impacts on water
   resources. We find that higher capacity and appropriate technology of
   the WWTPs will result in higher gray water footprint reduction. On
   average, 6.78 m(3) gray water footprint is reduced when 1 m(3) domestic
   sewage is treated in WWTPs in China. 13.38 L freshwater are required to
   produce the 0.4 kWh electrical input needed for treating 1 m(3) domestic
   wastewater, and 0.23 kg CO2 is emitted during this process. The
   wastewater characteristics, treatment technologies as well as management
   systems have a major impact on the efficiency of energy utilization in
   reducing gray water footprint via these WWTPs. The additional climate
   impact associated with wastewater treatment should be considered in
   China due to the enormous annual wastewater discharge. Policy
   suggestions are provided based on results in this work and the features
   of China's energy and water distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Reservoir. In contrast, the absence of obvious peaks for MeHg in
   sediment from the upper reaches of the Wujiangdu Reservoir, consistent
   with low levels of organic matter, suggested that production of MeHg was
   limited. In sediment with high organic matter content, reduction
   occurred closer to the sediment surface, resulting in maximum MeHg
   concentration in these layers. The correlation between MeHg and organic

Abstract = {{Brazil has to expand its power generation capacities due to significant

   capacities in North Brazil, additional to wind and thermal power
   generation. However, new hydropower may affect environmentally and
   socially sensitive areas in the Amazon region negatively while thermal
   power generation produces greenhouse gas emissions. We therefore assess
   how future greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production in
   Brazil can be minimized by optimizing the daily dispatch of photovoltaic
   (PV), wind, thermal, and hydropower plants. Using a simulation model, we
   additionally assess the risk of loss of load. Results indicate that at
   doubled demand in comparison to 2013, only 2\% of power production has
   to be provided by thermal power. Existing reservoirs of hydropower are
   sufficient to balance variations in renewable electricity supply at an
   optimal mix of around 37\% of PV, 9\% of wind, and 50\% of hydropower
   generation. In a hydro-thermal only scenario, the risk of deficit
   increases tenfold, and thermal power production four-fold. A sensitivity

Abstract = {{The present study develops a reliability assessment method of wind

   the firm generation of integrated wind and hydropower. A combination of
   water resources model for a system of reservoirs that implements a

   power grid system model is implemented on hourly time step. This model
   was accompanied by a global genetic algorithm solver to determine
   optimum operation targets for each storage reservoir aiming at
   maximizing the 90th percentile power generation produced by the
   integration of wind and hydro over the entire simulation period.
   This model was applied on the reservoir storages and hydropower system
   in the Zambezi river basin to test if the storage reservoirs could be
   efficiently be used to offset wind power intermittence in South Africa
   subjected to the different physical and policy constraints. Based on the
   optimized target operation and hourly annual real data for the year
   2010, the water resources system and power interconnection system were
   simulated together to assess the maximum firm generation of power as a
   result of the new wind and hydro combination target for storage

   The result obtained indicates that high regulation of wind and hydro can
   be achieved as a result of combined operation and showed 45\% increase

Abstract = {{This study explores the ecological indicators relevant to long-term
   sustainability by the food-energy-water nexus among BRICS (Brazil, the
   Russian Federation, India, China, and South Africa). The sustainability
   issue arises with the EKC (environmental Kuznets curve) hypothesis and
   biodiversity that require proper resource allocation to provide food
   security among the BRICS countries. This study then employs principal
   component analysis to construct a food security index comprising
   agricultural machinery, land under cereal production, and agricultural
   value added. Furthermore, it employs dynamic panel modeling in a GMM
   (generalized method of moments) system to obtain reliable parameter
   estimates. The results reveal that energy shortages and inadequate water
   resources impair the BRICS' food security. Economic growth amplifies
   energy demand and environmental degradation. Depletion of forests and
   natural resources encumbers economic prosperity, which is driven by
   rapid industrialization, high growth, domestic investment, improved
   water sources, and labor force participation. The EKC hypothesis tested
   across the BRICS countries, with the finding that an inverted U curve
   indeed does exist between carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth
   for Brazil, India, and South Africa, even if not for the entire panel of

   the EF under various assumptive extended buildings' lifetime scenarios

   show that if the average buildings' lifetime in China can be extended

   equivalent to the corresponding annual EF of Belgium, Mexico, and Italy.
   These findings will urge China to extend the lifetime of existing and
   new buildings, in order to reduce the EF from further urbanization. This
   paper also verifies that the lifetime of a product or the replacement
   rate of a sector is a very important factor that influences the

Abstract = {{At 16:30 (Beijing time) on August 3rd, 2014, an Ms 6.5 earthquake
   occurred in Ludian County in Yunnan Province, China. The Ludian
   earthquake triggered a collapse in Chapingzi, right bank of the
   Niulanjiang River, and a landslide in Hongshiyan at the left bank on the
   same location. These events occurred 1.5 km downstream of the Hongshiyan
   hydropower station. Debris deposits from the collapse and the landslide
   blocked the river channel and formed a landslide dam. In this study, the
   Hongshiyan landslide dam induced by the Ludian earthquake was chosen as
   the study case to discuss integrated landslide dam management and its
   potential hydropower uses. After emergency management measures are
   carried out, further analysis shows the outflow through the Hongshiyan
   landslide dam is manageable, which indicate safety issues are
   controllable. Two management schemes are discussed in this paper: one
   that uses the Hongshiyan landslide dam for power generation and one that
   removes the debris deposit. The result shows that using the strengthened
   landslide dam for power generation is feasible and economically sound.

Abstract = {{There are over 580 million people in sub-Saharan Africa without access
   to electricity. The region has significant untapped hydropower potential
   that could contribute to improving domestic access to electricity and
   countries' economic development, as well as helping to meet the
   Sustainable Development Goals. Changes in climate affect hydropower
   generation through alterations to river flow regimes. Hence it is the
   energy source most likely to be affected by climate change because the
   amount of electricity generated is directly related to water quantity
   and its timing. However, climate change impacts are rarely explicitly
   considered when planning new hydropower projects in the region. This may
   be because current fluvial discharge series in sub-Saharan Africa
   display high levels of natural variability and it is only after the
   2050s that climate-driven changes in river flows emerge from these.
   Planning horizons of hydropower projects are usually around 30 years, so
   the natural variability of the existing hydrological regime is within
   the variability of climate change projections and hence it is unlikely
   to be considered. Another reason is that over the past 15 years China
   has become a significant financer of infrastructure in the region. China
   only meets the environmental regulations of the country in which the
   hydropower scheme is being constructed. Most sub-Saharan African
   countries do not have regulations that include climate change in the
   planning of such projects. This paper concludes by suggesting a
   framework via which climate change can be incorporated in future
   hydropower schemes at a river basin scale.}},

Abstract = {{This article adopts a holistic approach to explore and quantify
   interactions between water and energy in the context of climate change
   in North Africa. We bring together results from different research areas
   to describe the physical interactions and to shortly discuss governance
   issues in the sectors of water and energy. We highlight the fact that
   water demand management options combined with a sustainable energy model
   is a priority action to answer the challenge of climate change
   adaptation in North African countries. We use the IPAT formula approach
   to compute scenarios for quantifying the magnitudes of advantages to
   expect from water demand side management actions coupled with energy
   efficiency options. According to our results, water demand management is
   a very appropriate adaptation option with significant benefits in terms
   of water saving, energy use and energy bill. Overall, in 2050, the water
   saved thanks to demand management actions could be around 68 billion of
   cubic meters, which is the magnitude of the total water demand of Egypt
   in 2005. Depending on the scenario and assumptions, the expected
   cumulated benefit in terms of energy bill over the period 2005-2025
   could range between 30 and 48 billion US Dollar, which is comparable to
   the GDP of Tunisia in 2011 (46 billion US Dollar). Nevertheless, up to
   2050, regardless the scenario, additional options will be needed to
   cover the water deficit of the region. This leads us to consider virtual
   water as an additional option to reduce the local water demand. Finally,
   we discuss the political implications and the reforms to be implemented
   for integrating water and energy demand side policies in North Africa.}},

Title = {{The integration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles into
   the power system of the Dubrovnik region}},
Journal = {{ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, governments
   seek to replace conventional fuels by renewable ones. Nowadays, most
   attention is paid to electric vehicles in the transport systems and the
   use of renewable energy in the power systems. The aim of this work is to
   achieve a 100 \% renewable and sustainable system and to examine the
   impact of electrification in the transport sector on the power curve and
   the integration of renewable energy into the power systems of the
   Dubrovnik region up to 2050.
   Methods: The analyses of different charging regulation models for the
   electric vehicles were derived in the EnergyPLAN, which is a computer
   model for Energy Systems Analysis of the major energy systems and runs
   on an hourly basis. Calculations were done for selected years-2020, 2030
   and 2050. Charging models provided in the EnergyPLAN were dumb charge,
   flexible demand, smart charge and smart charge with vehicle-to-grid. For
   each year, two different charging models were selected. Charging
   regulations according to three tariff models, based on a lower and
   higher electricity price, with different distributions, were also done
   for 2050, i.e. tariff model 1, 2 and 3.
   Results: The results for the year 2020 showed no difference between the
   models. In 2030, smart charge gained better results than a flexible
   demand. In 2050, the flexible demand allowed to achieve better results
   than the smart charge with vehicle-to-grid and the tariff model 1, while
   tariff model 3 provided the best results for 2050. It is also shown that
   the energy systems which include electric vehicles have a greater impact
   on the reduction of a critical excess electricity production than the
   systems excluding electric vehicles.
   Conclusions: The power system of the Dubrovnik region was set up as an
   isolated system, and the electric vehicle batteries are the only storage
   provided. The results showed that each scenario yielded an excess in
   electricity produced in the system, which means that the available
   storage was insufficient and there was a need for more storage
   capacities in order to achieve a 100 \% renewable and sustainable power
   system.}},

Title = {{Effects of a diversion hydropower facility on the hydrological regime of
   the Correntes River, a tributary to the Pantanal floodplain, Brazil}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{531}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Facilities that produce hydroelectricity by diversion of part of the
   river's flow, which are often considered to have lower environmental
   impact than conventional hydropower dams, are being built in large
   numbers on river systems throughout the world, yet their cumulative
   impacts are not well understood. This study evaluated the hydrological
   effects of operation of a diversion hydropower facility on the Correntes
   River in Brazil (mean discharge 73 m(3) s(-1)), which is potentially
   important because of the ecological implications for the floodplains of
   the Pantanal into which it flows. Many similar dams are built or
   proposed on rivers feeding the Pantanal. The 210-MW facility known as
   Ponte de Pedra diverts part of the river flow into a diversion channel
   in a nearly ``run-of-river{''} design. The natural (reconstructed) and
   regulated (observed) flow regimes were characterized using Indicators of
   Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) and Flow Duration Curves (FDC). Seven
   parameters of IHA were significantly altered by the reservoir formation
   (magnitude of lowest monthly flow, minimum flows of 1, 3 and 7 days,
   maximum flow of 90 days and counts of high and low pulses). Among these,
   Principal Components Analysis identified the maximum flow of 90 days and
   the count of high flow pulses as integrators of hydrological
   alterations. The FDC showed that the reservoir also changed the seasonal
   regime of the flows, with greater changes in the lowest flow season. The
   reduction of river-floodplain connectivity and loss of associated
   ecosystem services are the major downstream ecological implications of
   this altered flow regime. To maintain the seasonal flooding regime while
   meeting the requirements for hydroelectric production, proposed limits
   for flow regime alterations are up to +/-18\% in low flow, +/-24\% in
   the rising limb and +/-22\% in high flow and the falling limb, relative
   to the natural flow. Operational changes to maintain flows with these
   limits could easily be implemented because the hydrological alterations
   attributed to the reservoir and operations of its dam are modest
   compared to seasonal variation in river flow. Without attention to
   maintaining the natural flow regime, the cumulative effects of diversion
   hydropower dams like this one will significantly alter the ecohydrology
   of downstream rivers and floodplains. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, local load-redistribution is employed to study the
   vulnerability of the US power grid subjected to attacks, and the initial
   load of power node is assumed as the linear summation of its degree and
   the sum of its neighbors' degrees. Based on the simulation results, we
   find that with the decrease of the initial load of power node, the
   critical threshold of tolerance parameter increases subjected to the
   highest load node-based attack, but the critical threshold decreases
   subjected to the lowest load node-based attacks. Meanwhile, we discover
   that the critical threshold subjected to the lowest load node-based
   attack is larger than that subjected to the highest load node-based
   attack when the tunable parameter alpha is an element of{[}0.1, 0.9].
   Moreover, this paper compares the new model with the other two existing
   models, and the results illustrate that there are many similarities
   between these two existing models, but they are different from the new
   model presented in this paper. Furthermore, the infimum of tolerance
   parameter is proposed to portray the minimum cost of power grid, which
   can give a method to construct more robust power grids in the future.

Abstract = {{With the recognition of the external benefits of rural hydropower (RHP),
   much attention has been devoted to the development of RHP in China.
   However, investigations on a large number of sites built before 1995

   this paper reviews the existing status of RHP's development and rural
   hydropower renovation planning from 2011 to 2015 in China. The key
   challenges that are existing for these renovation projects are
   summarized. Secondly, renovation schemes with a specialized management
   framework responsible for project proceedings, subsidies allocation and
   environmental impact supervision are elaborated for the renovation
   project. Thirdly, a guarantee mechanism is analysed, which will promote
   the scale-up development of RHP, including fund management, property
   rights reform and feed-in tariff improvements. Finally, a realistic

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to comprehensively review the current
   status of small hydro power development in India and develop scenarios
   of growth. Potential and installed capacity, technological status,
   policy and regulatory support to small hydro power and the whole process
   of developing a small hydro power plant have been comprehensively
   reviewed. Major barriers in the growth of the small hydro power
   development have been identified. In India, plants with an installed
   capacity of up to 25 MW are considered as small hydro power plants, and
   Ministry of New and Renewable Energy of Government of India has been
   vested with the responsibility of developing this sector. Considerable
   growth in the development of small hydro power has been witnessed in the
   recent past; however, nearly three-quarters of the total identified
   potential of 20,000 MW is yet to be tapped. The country aims at
   harnessing at least half of the potential in the next 10 years. Future
   growth scenarios of small hydro power up to 2050 have been developed
   using Vensim DSS package. Model simulation indicates that with the
   current rate of capacity addition, the country will not be able to fully
   exploit small hydro power potential even by 2050. Hence, the country
   must make all attempts to accelerate the growth of the small hydro power
   because it has significant potential to contribute to energy poverty
   alleviation in rural and remotes areas. A sensitivity analysis has been
   carried out to investigate the effect of different parameters on the

Abstract = {{The recently released Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA55) data are

   Interim version of the next European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
   Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), Modern Era
   Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and Climate
   Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), in terms of global energy and water
   balances. All four reanalyses show an energy imbalance at TOA and
   surface. Especially, clouds in JRA-55 are optically weaker than those in
   the three other reanalyses, leading to excessive outgoing longwave
   radiation, which in turn causes negative net energy flux at TOA.
   Moreover, JRA-55 has a negative imbalance at surface and at TOA, which
   is attributed to systematic positive biases in latent heat flux over the
   ocean. As for the global water balance, all reanalyses present a similar
   spatial pattern of the difference between evaporation and precipitation
   (E-P). However, JRA-55 has a relatively strong negative (positive) E-P
   in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and South Pacific Convergence Zone
   (extratropical regions) due to overestimated precipitation
   (evaporation), in spite of the global net being close to zero. In time
   series analysis, especially in E-P, significant stepwise changes occur
   in MERRA, CFSR and ERAInterim due to the changes in the satellite
   observing system used in the data assimilation. Both MERRA and CFSR show
   a strong downward E-P shift in 1998, simultaneously with the start of
   the assimilation of AMSU-A sounding radiances. ERA-Interim exhibits an
   upward E-P shift in 1992 due to changes in observations from the SSM/ I
   of new DMSP satellites. On the contrary, JRA-55 exhibits less trends and
   remains stable over time, which may be caused by newly available,
   homogenized observations and advances in data assimilation technique.}},

   considered. The optimized system parameters are obtained from the
   monthly average solar radiation data, temperature data, and wind speed

   battery state of charge along with available battery input power over
   the year are detailed, analyzed, and compared. The techno-economic

   comparison with standalone PV or wind system is found to be \$0.413 for
   Andrott island with 1 kW PV array, 1 kW wind turbine, eight numbers of

Abstract = {{Emissions of CO2 and CH4 from freshwater reservoirs constitute a
   globally significant source of atmospheric greenhouse gases ( GHGs), but
   knowledge gaps remain with regard to spatiotemporal drivers of
   emissions. We document the spatial and seasonal variation in surface
   diffusion of CO2 and CH4 from Douglas Lake, a hydropower reservoir in
   Tennessee, USA. Monthly estimates across 13 reservoir sites from January
   to November 2010 indicated that surface diffusions ranged from 236 to
   18,806 mg . m- 2 . day- 1 for CO2 and 0 to 0.95 mg . m- 2 . day- 1 for
   CH4. Next, we developed statistical models using spatial and
   physicochemical variables to predict surface diffusions of CO2 and CH4.
   Models explained 22.7\% and 20.9\% of the variation in CO2 and CH4
   diffusions respectively, and identified pH, temperature, dissolved
   oxygen, and Julian day as the most informative predictors. These
   findings provide baseline estimates of GHG emissions from a reservoir in
   eastern temperate North America, a region for which estimates of
   reservoir GHGs emissions are limited. Our statistical models effectively
   characterized non-linear and threshold relationships between
   physicochemical predictors and GHG emissions. Further refinement of such
   modeling approaches will aid in predicting current GHG emissions from
   unsampled reservoirs and forecasting future GHG emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Hydropower is known as a typical renewable energy with maturely

Abstract = {{The Chinese province of Shandong, and more particularly its cities
   Dezhou, Jinan and Rizhao, have established an international reputation
   of being hotbeds for solar water heating (SWH) technology development
   and dissemination. The article aims to unveil the evolution of this
   innovative environment by applying the Functions of Innovation Systems
   (FIS) approach to the Chinese province of Shandong. It examines the
   actors, institutions and policy instruments that shape Shandong's
   innovation system for SWH, the dominant drivers and barriers during the
   evolution of the TIS and also assesses the applicability of the IS
   approach to China. It appears that the presence of influential interest
   organizations and proactive support from local governments have acted as
   strong drivers for the emergence of Shandong's innovation system for
   SWHs. On the other hand, the lack of adequate personnel and an
   overreliance on government policies act as main barriers. With regard to
   the Chinese specificities potentially detracting from the relevance of
   applying IS theory to China, we did not find that the central government
   acted as an initiator of innovation nor that state-owned enterprises had
   dominant positions in the market. In this innovative industry the
   impetus for development came from the bottom up and from private
   corporations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the impacts of multiple water uses on the operation
   of a system of existing reservoirs that originally were designed for
   hydropower generation. The research reported in this paper utilizes a
   nonlinear optimization model, developed to optimize hydropower
   production for a system of interconnected reservoirs. This model was
   modified to include water withdrawals for consumptive uses. The
   formulated multiobjective optimization problem is solved by employing
   the weighting method. The formulation considers water allocation policy
   for consumptive uses and individual hydropower plants. By parametrically
   varying the weighting coefficients, the tradeoff relationship (Pareto
   front) between hydropower generation and water demand for consumptive
   uses was traced out. The modified model is applied to the Sao Francisco
   River Basin in Brazil, where there are several hydropower plants in
   operation with a total installed capacity of 10.7 GW. The river basin is
   an important agricultural land that requires water supply for crop
   irrigation. The power generation loss as a result of increased water
   demand due to consumptive uses was evaluated. Water demand scenarios
   range from current estimated consumptive uses to the amount expected to
   be granted by the federal government in the future. It is concluded that
   these demands cannot fully be met in critical drought periods, and the
   proposed methodology can be helpful in leading to more equitable

Abstract = {{The Badain Jaran Desert is the second-largest area of shifting sands in
   China. Our first measurements of the energy components and water vapor
   fluxes on a megadune using eddy covariance technology were taken from
   April 2012 to April 2013. The results indicate that the longwave and
   shortwave radiative fluxes exhibited large fluctuations and seasonal
   dynamics. The total radiative energy loss by longwave and shortwave
   radiation was greater on the megadune than from other underlying
   surfaces. The radiation partitioning was different in different seasons.
   The land-atmosphere interaction was primarily represented by the
   sensible heat flux. The average sensible heat flux (40.1 W/m(2)) was
   much larger than the average latent heat flux (14.5 W/m(2)). Soil heat
   flux played an important role in the energy balance. The mean actual
   evaporation was 0.41 mm/d, and the cumulative actual evaporation was
   approximately 150 mm/a. The water vapor would transport downwardly and
   appear as dew condensation water. The amount of precipitation determined
   the actual evaporation. The actual evaporation was supposed to be equal
   to the precipitation on the megadune and the precipitation was difficult
   to recharge the groundwater. Our study can provide a foundation for

   Accurate assessment of the potential costs/benefits of investment

   were found with the adoption of the new technology, which saved both
   water and energy use, reduced total GHG emissions and resulted in net

Abstract = {{Aquaponics is a form of aquaculture that integrates hydroponics to raise
   edible plants and fish. There is growing interest in aquaponics because
   it can be practiced in non-traditional locations for agriculture such as
   inside warehouses and on marginal lands, and it can provide locally
   grown products without using synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers,
   or antibiotics. Yet questions remain about the ecological and economic
   sustainability of aquaponics. The objective of this study was to
   describe the operating conditions, inputs (energy, water, and fish feed)
   and outputs (edible crops and fish) and their relationship over two
   years for a small-scale raft aquaponics operation in Baltimore,
   Maryland, United States. The system had roughly 1\% water loss per day
   and used an average of 35,950 L for replenishment per year. Predicted
   values suggest rainfall could completely replace the existing water
   needs. The average energy use was 19,526 kWh for propane and electricity
   per year at a cost of \$2055 US dollars. The largest uses of electricity
   were in-tank water heaters. Comparing inputs to outputs, 104 L of water,
   0.5 kg feed, and 56 kWh energy (\$6 in energy costs) were needed to
   produce 1 kg of crops; and 292 L of water, 1.3 kg feed, and 159 kWh of
   energy (\$12 in energy costs) were needed to produce a 1 kg increase in
   tilapia. Raising tilapia was a net loss, while raising crops was a net
   gain when comparing market prices to energy costs. Understanding energy,
   water, and feed use in aquaponic systems is essential to inform farm
   business plans. These data can serve as a point of comparison to other
   small-scale aquaponic systems, and inform future work on life cycle
   assessments of aquaponics. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the present scenario, tapping the unutilised hydropower potential is
   one of the highest priorities in developing countries of the world.
   Special emphasis is being imparted to run of the river (RoR) mode of
   power generation. However, the governments are now facing the dilemma
   whether to promote small hydropower projects (SHPs) or encourage large
   hydropower projects (LHPs). RoR large hydropower projects result into
   large scale cutting of mountains for constructing tunnels and access
   roads, generation of huge quantity of muck and large scale impact on
   flora and fauna due to diversion of rivers/streams. On the other hand,
   though SHPs are claimed to be greener and more sustainable by a section
   of researchers and energy planners but, they will be required to be set
   up in large number to generate equivalent amount of electricity. The aim
   of this study is to rank the most sustainable installed capacity range
   of RoR hydropower projects. To achieve this aim, the study proposes the
   use of quite popular multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method of
   Operation Research named Analytical Hierarchy Process. A case study has
   been presented from Himachal Pradesh, a hydro rich state located in the
   western Himalayan region. As per sustainability assessment carried out
   in this study, hydropower projects in the capacity range 1 to 5 MW have
   been ranked to be the most sustainable.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed an operational model to simulate water and energy
   fluxes in the Haihe River Basin (231,800 km(2) in size) for the past 28
   years. This model is capable of estimating water and energy fluxes of
   irrigated croplands and heterogeneous grids. The model was validated
   using actual evapotranspiration (ETa) measured by an eddy covariance
   system, measured soil moisture in croplands, groundwater level
   measurements over the piedmont plain and runoff observations in a
   mountainous catchment. A long-term time series of water and energy
   balance components were then simulated at a daily time step by
   integrating remotely sensed information and meteorological data to
   examine the spatial and temporal distribution and changes in water and
   energy fluxes in the basin over the past 28 years. The results show that
   net radiation (R-n) in the mountainous regions is generally higher than
   that in the plain regions. ETa, in the plain regions is higher than that
   in the mountainous regions mostly because of higher air temperature and
   larger areas of irrigated farmland. Higher sensible heat flux (H) and
   lower ETa in the urban areas are possibly due to less vegetation cover,
   an impervious surface, rapid drainage, and the heat island effect of
   cities. During the study period, a water deficit continuously occurred
   in the plain regions because of extensive pumping of groundwater for
   irrigation to meet the crop water requirements. Irrigation has led to
   significant groundwater depletion, which poses a substantial challenge
   to the sustainability of water resources in this basin. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In southern Africa, the connections between climate and the
   water-energy-food nexus are strong. Physical and socioeconomic exposure
   to climate is high in many areas and in crucial economic sectors.
   Spatial interdependence is also high, driven, for example, by the
   regional extent of many climate anomalies and river basins and aquifers
   that span national boundaries. There is now strong evidence of the
   effects of individual climate anomalies, but associations between
   national rainfall and gross domestic product and crop production remain
   relatively weak. The majority of climate models project decreases in
   annual precipitation for southern Africa, typically by as much as 20\%
   by the 2080s. Impact models suggest these changes would propagate into
   reduced water availability and crop yields. Recognition of spatial and
   sectoral interdependencies should inform policies, institutions and
   investments for enhancing water, energy and food security. Three key
   political and economic instruments could be strengthened for this
   purpose: the Southern African Development Community, the Southern
   African Power Pool and trade of agricultural products amounting to

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Small Hydro Power (SHP) is one of the most important renewable energy
   generation sources. It is a cost-effective technology that is being used
   for rural electrification in the developing countries including India.
   The Indian government is providing attractive initiatives to the private
   investors to promote faster development of SHP. Until now, a lot has
   been written about assessment, potential, advantages and the technical
   aspects of the SHP plants. However, the important business
   sustainability perspective has not been yet subjected to empirical
   analysis. Sustainable development involves three interconnected
   dimensions: social, economic and environmental sustainability. This
   paper attempts to investigate whether SHP business in India is a
   sustainable business. The study is based on the analysis of qualitative
   data acquired through 28 in-depth interviews with various actors that
   are connected to the SHP industry in India which include Independent
   Power Producers (IPPs), manufacturers, designers, consultants and
   representatives of various government organizations. The empirical
   material was collected in four states of India namely New Delhi,
   Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir (J\&K) in February,
   2013. The data was acquired by individual in-depth interviews, group
   discussions and direct observation of one SHP plant. The results show
   that all the three dimensions of sustainability are being realized to a
   certain extent. However, utmost efforts have to be undertaken in order
   to call this sector completely sustainable. Both benefits and challenges
   in all these dimensions are highlighted and recommendations towards a
   sustainable SHP sector are provided. Further, this study also proposes
   suggestions for the interested investors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Brazil's large territory displays significant richness in caves with
   about 12 thousand caves already recorded. Nevertheless, studies on bats
   in these environments are extremely scarce and fragmented. This study
   characterized the chiropteran fauna from two sandstone caves under the
   influence of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam (Belo Monte UHE) in Para,
   Brazil. The Kararao and Kararao Novo caves are located on the same
   ridge, 250 m apart. Three expeditions were carried out in 2013 and 2014,
   with a 4- to 5-month interval in between. A total of 589 animals were
   caught, 246 in the Kararao cave and 343 in the Kararao Novo cave.
   Fifteen species were recorded (13 in each cave) representing 79\%
   similarity. With the exception of Vampyrum spectrum, which is not a cave
   species, the remaining recorded species were mostly cave bat species.
   Some species seemed to use the caves seasonally, although the basis of
   this pattern is still unknown. The most commonly observed species were
   Pteronotus personatus (dominant in the Kararao cave), P. parnellii
   (dominant in the Kararao Novo cave), and Lionycteris spurrelli, which
   accounted for 65\% of all captures recorded for the two caves. Natalus
   macrourus is a species recorded in the Kararao cave that is regionally
   threatened with extinction. Both caves are less than 500 m from the
   future reservoir; however, because the Kararao cave entry is in an area
   that is lower than the reservoir, it can suffer alterations that would
   affect its dynamics. This raises great concern about the cave's

Abstract = {{Water and energy optimization are needed for sustainable production of
   scented rice. The present study was, conducted to investigate the effect
   of transplanting methods and irrigation schedules on water productivity
   and energy use in this production system. The experiment was laid out in
   split plot design with three methods of planting (Mechanical planting
   with 4 passes of puddling, mechanical planting with 2 passes of puddling
   and manual planting with 4 passes of puddling) in the main plots and
   combinations of two initial ponding durations (7 and 14 days) and four
   subsequent irrigation schedules (2, 3, 4, and 5 days after disappearance
   of ponded water) in sub-plots. The methods of transplanting with
   different levels of puddling did not exhibit any significant effect on
   grain yield and quality. However, mechanically and manually transplanted
   crop with 4 passes of puddling resulted in saving of 11.9 and 11.5 cm
   irrigation water with 6.7 and 3.3\% higher apparent water productivity
   than mechanically transplanted crop with 2 passes of puddling,
   respectively. The energy productivity was higher in mechanically
   transplanted crop with 2 passes of puddling than in same system or the
   system of hand transplanting with 4 passes of puddling. Two weeks
   initial ponding after transplanting resulted in 15.9\% higher grain
   yield with significantly superior brown and milled rice recoveries than
   one week of initial ponding. The energy input, energy productivity and
   net return of 2 weeks ponding were 9.6, 5.7 and 20.9\% higher than one
   week ponding, respectively. Applying subsequent irrigation at 2 and 3
   days after disappearance of ponded water resulted in 12.9 \& 24.6, and
   8.4 \& 19.6\% higher grain yield as compared to irrigation at 4 and 5
   days after disappearance of ponded water, respectively. Irrigation at 2
   days after disappearance of ponded water resulted in the highest water
   application (166.6 cm), which was 22.8, 31.0 and 46.3\% higher than 3, 4
   and 5 days after disappearance of ponded water, respectively. Apparent
   crop water productivity, energy use efficiency and energy productivity
   was higher under irrigation at 3 days after disappearance of ponded
   water while net returns and benefit:cost ratio (B:C) was higher under
   irrigation at 2 days after disappearance of ponded water. Thus, basmati
   rice can be transplanted either mechanically or manually with 4 passes
   of puddling for water saving. There must be 2 weeks initial ponding with
   subsequent irrigation application at 3 days after disappearance of
   ponded water to realize maximum productivity with quality grains. (C)

Abstract = {{Complex block-flexure slope toppling is observed in interbedded
   sandstone and slate in the upper Yellow River, China. Block toppling is
   observed in the relatively hard sandstone and flexural toppling is
   observed in the relatively soft slate. The evolution of toppling slope
   deformation is characterized by long-term progress and spatial
   variability. In order to study these characteristics, field
   investigations, adit prospecting, borehole drilling, sonic tests and
   numerical simulation were carried out. In addition, the effect of the
   structure, the composite mode of the rock mass, the unloading fissures
   and geomorphology are discussed. Furthermore, we explored the toppling
   mechanisms and simulated it numerically; on this basis, the slope
   evolution is divided into four stages. Results obtained from the
   numerical simulation compared well with field investigation data
   (investigation data, rock sonic survey and strata dip statistics).
   Comparative studies have demonstrated that the analytical methods
   presented in this paper are appropriate for back analysis of the
   toppling evolution process. The result showed that this toppling slope
   has not yet entered the later progressivity failure stage and is
   currently limited to collapse at shallow levels, whereas the deep-seated
   rock mass will remain stable for a long time. This study might provide
   reference for a stability evaluation and hazard prevention analysis for
   rock toppling.}},

Abstract = {{Brazil plans to construct many new hydroelectric dams in the Amazon
   region. The new conditions of flooding promoted by reservoirs can alter
   photosynthetic processes, and the study of physiological responses of
   trees can be used for selected suitable species to reforest these
   altered areas. The present study analyzed changes in pigment content and
   photosynthetic performance in flood-tolerant and flood-intolerant
   species that are common in the floodplains along the Uatum (a) over
   tilde River and on islands in the reservoir of the Balbina Hydroelectric
   Dam. Their photosynthetic responses were tested using chloroplast
   pigment content and chlorophyll a fluorescence. Flooding caused a
   significant reduction in pigment content in all of the three
   flood-intolerant species and in one of the seven flood-tolerant species
   studied. Flood-tolerant species were unaffected and neither a change in
   their chlorophyll contents nor a decrease in the efficiency of energy
   use in the photosynthetic process was observed. From chlorophyll a
   fluorescence transients (OJIP transients) was calculated the performance
   index (PIABS), a parameter derived from the OJIP transient by means of
   the JIP-test (translation of original fluorescence measurements into
   biophysical expressions quantifying the stepwise flow of energy through
   photosystem II). This parameter was a very sensitive indicator of the
   physiological status of trees under field and was shown to be a
   particularly sensitive indicator of stress tolerance in flood-intolerant
   species during inundation, whereas flood-tolerant species had only minor
   reductions in their photosynthetic performance. We suggest that tree
   species selection for reforestation around reservoirs can benefit from
   species-specific measurements of photosynthetic response using the
   JIP-test.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing severe water deficiency has led to an urgent need for better
   water resource management, especially in China. Electric power systems
   have been recognized as large water consumers; therefore, comprehensive
   analysis of their water use is needed. This study aims to analyze the
   flux and direction of virtual water and virtual scarce water within
   power system based on transmission-consumption water intensity (TCWI). A
   case study is then conducted to investigate China's electric power
   system. The results show that including the water stress index (WSI) and
   virtual scarce flow concept largely influences the analysis of
   interregional virtual water flows. Regardless the WSIs, there are four
   regions exporting virtual water (northeast, north, northwest and
   central) and two regions exporting virtual scarce water (east and
   south). While considering the virtual scarce water, the central region
   becomes a big exporter with 144.12 GL of virtual scarce water outflow.
   In addition, the virtual water and virtual scarce water flux among these
   six regions reaches 726 GL and 163 GL, respectively. The electric
   transmission system transfers virtual scarce water from inland areas to
   coastal areas, which is roughly the opposite of the distribution of
   China's water resources. The virtual water analysis incorporating the
   water scarcity not only largely increases the effectiveness of the
   results, but also provides more valuable and accurate information for
   water-efficient management and planning in electric power system. (C)

   consumption and life-cycle impacts of thermoelectric generation and
   biofuel production, and freshwater availability and sectoral allocations
   from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Bank.
   Emerging, energy-related water scarcity flashpoints include the world's
   largest, most diversified economies (Brazil, India, China, and USA among
   others), while physical water scarcity continues to pose limits to
   energy development in the Middle East and small-island states. Findings
   include the following: (a) technological obstacles to alleviate water
   scarcity driven by energy demand are surmountable; (b) resource
   conservation is inevitable, driven by financial limitations and
   efficiency gains; and (c) institutional arrangements play a pivotal role
   in the virtuous water-energy-climate cycle. We conclude by making
   reference to coupled energy-water policy alternatives including
   water-conserving energy portfolios, intersectoral water transfers,
   virtual water for energy, hydropower tradeoffs, and use of impaired
   waters for energy development.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, spatial and temporal changes in water and energy fluxes
   were investigated over the past 28 years along with relevant factors in
   the Haihe River Basin in North China, which is currently facing an
   increasingly severe water shortage. Water and energy fluxes in different
   topographical regions have been affected by both climate change and
   human activities. In the plain regions, actual evapotranspiration (ETa)
   has generally decreased during the study period, which can be attributed
   to decreased net radiation, precipitation and rapid urbanization. The
   water deficit has continued in the plains regions due to extensive
   pumping for irrigation to meet the deficit of crop water. However,
   irrigation has led to significant groundwater depletion, which poses a
   significant challenge to the sustainability of water resources. In the
   mountain regions, decreases in sensible heat flux and increases in ETa
   have caused a decrease in the Bowen ratio. These changes in water and
   energy fluxes have brought a positive ecological effect, but the
   increase in ETa in the mountain regions has resulted in a substantial
   reduction of water yield and consequently a negative effect on water
   resources in this basin. These changes in water and energy fluxes across
   the Haihe River Basin have made the water issue more complex and require
   integrated river basin management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{As part of its energy transition strategy, China has set ambitious
   targets for increasing the contribution of renewable energy and, in
   particular, of wind power. However, the Chinese power sector has not
   undergone the necessary reforms to facilitate the integration and
   absorption of a larger share of variable renewable energy. This is
   evident from the difficulties in absorbing wind power from already
   commissioned wind farms and the resultant curtailment of wind power.
   Pumped storage hydroelectricity (PSH) is a flexible power source that
   can facilitate higher penetration levels of wind power as well as
   complement China's growing nuclear power capacity. However, regulatory
   policy constraints have restricted the effective utilization of existing
   PSH capacity and discouraged investment in new PSH capacity. This paper
   examines these constraints and assesses the likely impact of new
   policies designed to address them. Finally, policy recommendations and
   concluding remarks are provided. This paper contributes to the
   literature on renewable energy integration from a new perspective. The

Abstract = {{Demand for hydropower is increasing, yet the water footprints (WFs) of
   reservoirs and hydropower, and their contributions to water scarcity,
   are poorly understood. Here, we calculate reservoir WFs (freshwater that
   evaporates from reservoirs) and hydropower WFs (the WF of
   hydroelectricity) in China based on data from 875 representative
   reservoirs (209 with power plants). In 2010, the reservoir WF totaled
   27.9 x 10(9) m(3) (Gm(3)), or 22\% of China's total water consumption.
   Ignoring the reservoir WF seriously underestimates human water
   appropriation. The reservoir WF associated with industrial, domestic and
   agricultural WFs caused water scarcity in 6 of the 10 major Chinese
   river basins from 2 to 12 months annually. The hydropower WF was 6.6
   Gm(3) yr(-1) or 3.6 m(3) of water to produce a GJ (10(9) J) of
   electricity. Hydropower is a water intensive energy carrier. As a
   response to global climate change, the Chinese government has promoted a
   further increase in hydropower energy by 70\% by 2020 compared to 2012.
   This energy policy imposes pressure on available freshwater resources

Abstract = {{Increasing population and economic growth continue to drive China's
   demand for energy and water resources. The interaction of these
   resources is particularly important in China, where water resources are
   unevenly distributed, with limited availability in coal-rich regions.
   The ``3 Red Lines{''} water policies were introduced in 2011; one of
   their aims is to reduce industrial water use, of which the energy sector
   is a part. This paper analyses current water withdrawals and consumption
   for all energy processes and assesses the sector's compliance with the
   industrial water policy under different scenarios, considering potential
   future policy and technological changes. The results show that future
   energy plans could conflict with the industrial water policy, but the
   amount of water used in the energy sector is highly dependant on
   technology choices, especially for power plant cooling. High electricity
   demand in the future is expected to be met mainly by coal and nuclear
   power, and planned inland development of nuclear power presents a new
   source of freshwater demand. Taking a holistic view of energy and
   water-for-energy enables the identification of co-benefits and
   trade-offs between energy and water policies that can facilitate the
   development of more compatible and sustainable energy and water plans.

Abstract = {{Small hydropower plants, which are one of most important means for

   In this paper, a method for accounting the carbon dioxide emission of
   small hydropower plants is proposed. Twenty-six small hydropower plants
   (SHPs) in southwest China are chosen as a case study. The following
   results were found: (1) the carbon dioxide emission during the
   construction period (COEc) per installed capacity ranged between 0.01957
   t/kW and 0.1926 t/kW, with its average value 0.04592 t/kw; (2) the
   carbon dioxide emission during the construction period is classified
   into two groups; for each group, there is a reciprocal relationship
   between the installed capacity and the annual COEc per installed
   capacity, and (3) the annual CEOo (carbon dioxide emission during the
   operation period) declines with increasing installed capacity, the two
   related by a straight line. Specifically, when the installed capacity
   increases by 1 kW carbon emissions are reduced by 16.33 t. COEo is
   directly determined by hydropower. In addition, (4) the trend of carbon
   dioxide emission during the system lifecycle of SHPs is determined by
   COEo. The most important factor in determining the carbon dioxide
   emission of SHPs is to ensure the precise hydropower of SHPs. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Small hydropower (SHP) in China has experienced soring development in
   the past two decades and has been assigned ambitious development goals
   recently, while its environmental performance remains unclear. This
   study is intended to provide a comprehensive assessment of the
   environmental impacts of SHP plants in China, to compare the results
   with its counterparts in other countries, and to identify the key
   factors in the mitigation of negative consequences.
   A life cycle assessment of a SHP plant in Guizhou Province of China was
   conducted in a cradle-to-grave manner following the ISO 14040
   guidelines. The functional unit is defined as 1 MWh of net electricity
   produced by the plant. The CML 2001 method was applied to characterize
   the environmental impacts. The environmental impact categories
   considered in this study included global warming (GWP), abiotic
   depletion (ADP), acidification (AP), freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity
   (FAETP), human toxicity (HTP), and photochemical ozone creation (POCP).
   Further contribution analyses and sensitivity analysis was performed to
   identify the key contributors to each impact category during the life
   cycle of the plant.
   For the case plant, the considered impacts are caused primarily by the
   construction stage. As for the materials and energy inputs, cement,
   steel, and electricity are the three dominating ones for the overall
   environmental impacts. Compared with SHP plants in other countries, the
   plant performs similar to the MW scale plants in Thailand and Japan but
   worse than the plant in Switzerland. Further comparison of life cycle
   inventories (LCIs) revealed that the quality of hydro-energy resources
   and acquisition of indigenous equipment technology is essential to their
   environmental performance. The results of the sensitivity analysis
   suggested that the amount of construction materials and energy
   consumption as well as the plant output influences its environmental
   performance significantly.
   The construction stage of the SHP plant is the most important source of
   environmental impacts. To minimize the impacts of this stage,
   optimization of the structural design and application of new
   construction materials and good construction practices is recommended.
   In addition, determining suitable installed capacity and advancing
   equipment technologies to ensure the optimal output is also crucial to
   improve the environmental performance of SHP plants in China, regarding
   the current serious problem of unstable operation.}},

Abstract = {{Energy budget-based distributed modeling of snow and glacier melt runoff
   is essential in a hydrologic model to accurately describe hydrologic
   processes in cold regions and high-altitude catchments. We developed
   herein an integrated modeling system with an energy budget-based
   multilayer scheme for clean glaciers, a single-layer scheme for
   debris-covered glaciers, and multilayer scheme for seasonal snow over
   glacier, soil, and forest within a distributed biosphere hydrological
   modeling framework. Model capability is demonstrated for Hunza River
   Basin (13,733km(2)) in the Karakoram region of Pakistan on a 500m grid
   for 3 hydrologic years (2002-2004). Discharge simulation results show
   good agreement with observations (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency=0.93). Flow
   composition analysis reveals that the runoff regime is strongly
   controlled by the snow and glacier melt runoff (50\% snowmelt and 33\%
   glacier melt). Pixel-by-pixel evaluation of the simulated spatial
   distribution of snow-covered area against Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer-derived 8day maximum snow cover extent data indicates
   that the areal extent of snow cover is reproduced well, with average
   accuracy 84\% and average absolute bias 7\%. The 3year mean value of net
   mass balance (NMB) was estimated at +0.04myr(-1). It is interesting that
   individual glaciers show similar characteristics of NMB over 3years,
   suggesting that both topography and glacier hypsometry play key roles in
   glacier mass balance. This study provides a basis for potential
   application of such an integrated model to the entire
   Hindu-Kush-Karakoram-Himalaya region toward simulating snow and glacier
   hydrologic processes within a water and energy balance-based,
   distributed hydrological modeling framework.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing water withdrawals from many rivers of the world is leading to
   severe degradation in river ecosystems. Water is allocated for
   environmental needs so that a river can perform its natural functions.
   Environmental flows (EF) try to strike a balance between the use of
   water of a river for economic development, societal needs and delivering
   ecosystem services. This article describes a framework to assess
   environmental flows for a hydropower project in India in a situation
   where limited hydrological and very limited ecosystem data are
   available. It recommends that in such a situation, an acceptable EF
   regime can be arrived at by analysing hydrological data, supplemented by
   whatever ecosystem data are available and creating various scenarios of
   EFs. Benefits and impacts of different EF scenarios can then form the
   basis to determine an appropriate EF regime. Application of the
   framework is demonstrated in a case study in India. Adaptive management,
   where feedbacks are used to update and improve the decisions is helpful
   in such situations.}},

   different operating parameters (fresh air ratio, supply air temperature

   used for systems evaluations and comparisons. The results show that (i)
   the fresh water production rates of the proposed systems increase with
   increasing fresh air ratio, supply air temperature and outdoor wet bulb
   temperature, (ii) powers saving of the proposed systems increase with
   increasing fresh air ratio and supply air temperature and decreasing of
   the outdoor air wet bulb temperature, (iii) locating the evaporative
   cooling after the fresh air mixing remarkably increases water production
   rate, and (vi) incorporating heat recovery in the air conditioning
   systems with evaporative cooling may adversely affect both of the water
   production rate and the total cost saving of the system. Comparison

Abstract = {{Leaf area index (LAI) is a key parameter for the simulation of water and
   carbon cycle in many ecological and hydrological models. However, it is
   difficult to estimate the LAI dynamics accurately. In this work, a
   modified model based on the Logistic Statistical Model and the
   Mechanistic Model was developed to solve the problem of IBIS (Integrated
   Biosphere Simulator) in LAI simulation, which noted as IBIS-LAI.
   Comparison between the primary IBIS, IBIS-LAI, as well as Logistic
   Statistical Model and the Mechanistic Model are performed in Changbai
   Mountain broadleaved forest of China. Results show that model
   performance could be enhanced by modification of LAI simulation,
   especially in spring and autumn. The relative error of upper canopy LAI
   simulation by IBIS, IBIS-LAI, Logistic statistical model and mechanistic
   model is 86.80\%, 5.39\%, 8.25\% and 9.53\%, respectively; while the
   relative error of lower canopy LAI simulation is 80.01\%, 18.57\%,
   33.63\% and 20.94\%. With the improvement of LAI simulation accuracy,
   simulation of evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP)

Abstract = {{The role of greenhouse gas emissions from freshwater reservoirs and

   studied CO2 and CH4 diffusive fluxes from two large neotropical
   hydropower reservoirs with different climate conditions. We used
   floating closed-chambers to estimate diffusive fluxes of these gaseous
   species. Sampling campaigns showed that the reservoirs studied were
   sources of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. In the Serra da Mesa
   Reservoir, the CH4 emissions ranged from 0.530 to 396.96 mg.m(-2).d(-1)
   and CO2 emissions ranged from -1,738.33 to 11,166.61 mg.m(-2).d(-1) and
   in Tres Marias Reservoir the CH4 fluxes ranged 0.720 to 2,578.03
   mg.m(-2).d(-1) and CO2 emission ranged from -3,037.80 to 11,516.64 to
   mg.m(-2).d(-1). There were no statistically significant differences of
   CH4 fluxes between the reservoirs, but CO2 fluxes from the two
   reservoirs studied were significantly different. The CO2 emissions
   measured over the periods studied in Serra da Mesa showed some
   seasonality with distinctions between the wet and dry transition season.
   In Tres Marias Reservoir the CO2 fluxes showed no seasonal variability.
   In both reservoirs, CH4 emissions showed a tendency to increase during
   the study periods but this was not statistically significant. These
   results contributed to increase knowledge about the magnitude of CO2 and
   CH4 emission in hydroelectric reservoirs, however due to natural
   variability of the data future sampling campaigns will be needed to
   better elucidate the seasonal influences on the fluxes of greenhouse
   gases.}},

Abstract = {{Cage culture of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in large reservoirs is
   an emergent aquaculture practice in Brazil. Due to the availability of
   large amounts of suitable quality waters in hydroelectric dams, there is
   a large but still undetermined potential for cage aquaculture in the
   upper Parana River basin. Sustainable aquaculture production should
   consider assessment of ecological carrying capacity for rational use of
   natural resources such as water bodies. The present survey estimates the
   ecological carrying capacity for tilapia cage culture in several sites
   on a large reservoir of ``Ilha Solteira{''} upper Parana River basin,
   Southeastern Brazil. Ecological carrying capacity was estimated based on
   the Dillon and Rigler (1975) mass balance model, considering
   limnological and farming field data to evaluate area-specific Phosphorus
   loads that can be assimilated in these environments. Using average
   farming data of feed composition, tilapia (O. niloticus) whole body
   composition and Feed Conversion Rate (FCR), the estimated emission of
   Phosphorus per ton of fish produced was 14.8 kg P ton(-1). Modeling
   provided evidence for the importance of feed Phosphorus content and
   availability for determination of total allowable production, as well as
   the relevance of proper inputs of limnological field data. When field
   data was collected, only two sites (Ponte Pensa and Dourados) had
   aquaculture activities; as aquaculture is expanding, limnological
   information provided in the present study is a registry of conditions
   found before the massive aquaculture development. Production estimated
   to the reservoir as a whole (156,000 ton) is more than fivefold the
   pooled production (30,000 ton) of the fifteen selected sites; if
   production estimated to the reservoir as a whole cluster around a few
   best sites, than effects on water quality is expected to be even more
   drastic. The limit of 1\% occupancy by aquaculture posed by Brazilian
   government is not an effective safeguard against excessive
   eutrophication, and detailed limnological studies are demanded for each
   inlet assigned for cage aquaculture. The impact of cage fish farming on
   the aquatic environment by the release of nutrients that affect water
   quality can not only bring about conflict with multiple users, but also
   primarily exert a negative feedback effect in the cage operations
   themselves. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region stands out globally both
   for the immensity of its energy resources, and the paucity of its

   for 2 \% of the available sustainable supply. We examine how this demand
   could change over the 21st century, assuming growth in population and

   efficiency, carbon intensity, and energy exports from the region. We
   find that in the pathway marked by improved efficiency, a transition to

   consumption for energy is twice as high as today's values by the end of
   the century. By contrast, in the pathway marked by continued commitment
   to fossil resource extraction, use, and export, water demand for energy
   might rise by a factor of five. If the region were to maintain high

Abstract = {{The number of energy-water nexus studies has been increasing recently
   due to the significant linkages between energy generation and water
   consumption, but no study has looked at water quantity and quality
   impacts as well as carbon emissions associated with electricity
   production. Using integrated hybrid life cycle analysis, this study
   examines the life cycle impacts of pulverized coal, wind power and solar
   power on, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, water consumption and water
   quality in Inner Mongolia, China. Our research findings show that
   pulverized coal emits 1213.5 g of CO2 per kilowatt-hour (g/kW h) of
   electricity output, compared with 34.4 g/kW h for wind power and 67.4
   g/kW h for solar photovoltaic. Water consumption for pulverized coal,
   wind power and solar photovoltaic are 3.3, 0.7 and 0.9 l/kW h,
   respectively. The water requirement to dilute the life cycle chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) discharge would increase water consumption during
   production processes of pulverized coal, wind power and solar
   photovoltaic systems by 0.11, 0.09 and 0.19 l/kW h, respectively. Given
   that the State Grid Corporation of China aims to increase the power
   generation capacity that provides power supply to regions outside Inner
   Mongolia to 120 GW by 2020, electricity outflows could contribute 520
   million tonnes of CO2 emissions, which would be similar to the CO2
   emissions of the UK in 2010, and 1460.8 million m(3) of water. This
   study reveals that substantial reductions in CO2 emissions and water
   consumption can be attained if the existing coal-dominated power
   generation was substituted by wind power in Inner Mongolia. (C) 2015

   would be below 25\% of the total number of vehicles existing today,
   against the 100\% in the case of using electric vehicles. Furthermore, a
   network of 322 hydrogen stations would be necessary for refueling the
   maximum number of fuel cell vehicles, given the actual limitations of
   the electrical grid for hydrogen generation. Thus, considering that
   hydrogen used for refueling would be generated by electrolysis using the
   electrical grid, fuel cell vehicles would only be a 4\% less polluting
   than an internal combustion vehicle. However, if we could achieve a
   substitution ratio of 25\% of the total (CV by FCV, the Autonomous
   Region of Murcia could avoid the emission of up to 24,500 metric Tons of
   CO2 to the atmosphere every year. This value contrasts with the 2.2
   millions of metric tons of CO2 that could be avoided using electric
   vehicles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of underground caverns and the excavatability of rock
   masses are important for geotechnical engineering practices during the
   design and construction stages. The risks associated with underground
   caverns at the Houziyan hydropower station in Southwest China are
   growing due to excavation-induced unloading. To assess the instability
   of underground caverns and resolve the complex subsurface conditions of
   the highly fractured rock mass, a high-resolution microseismic
   monitoring system was established in deep underground caverns. This
   system was used to determine the relationship between the measured
   microseismic activities and the excavation damage zones of the
   surrounding rock mass. The excavation damage zones and potential risk
   regions in the underground caverns were identified by analyzing the
   tempo-spatial distribution of microseismic activities. In addition, the
   correlation between microseismic activities and pre-existing geological
   structures was determined, and traditional monitoring results were
   analyzed. To validate the correlation between seismicity and the
   excavation damaged zones of the underground caverns, a numerical model
   was employed to further evaluate the deformation and stability of the
   surrounding rock mass. The monitoring results demonstrate that
   microseismic events mainly occurred in high-stress-concentration
   regions, corresponding with the results obtained from the numerical
   analysis. Therefore, this comprehensive method, which incorporates
   microseismic monitoring, numerical analysis, traditional monitoring and
   field observations, is promising for predicting the deformation and
   instability of surrounding rock masses in the underground caverns
   subjected to excavation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Development of a probabilistic block theory analysis procedure and its
   application to a rock slope at a hydropower station in China}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{188}},
Pages = {{110-125}},
Month = {{APR 7}},
Abstract = {{The paper deals with a development of a new procedure to perform
   probabilistic block theory analysis using the vector method. The
   procedure includes the following three main features: (a) the joint
   orientation is considered as a bivariate distribution including the
   correlation that exists between the joint dip angle and dip direction
   angle; (b) the variability of discontinuity shear strength is
   incorporated in the analysis; (c) it performs deterministic and
   probabilistic block theory analysis including the mode of failure (MOF),
   maximum safe slope angle (MSSA), factor of safety (F-s) and the
   instability probabilities for different cut slope dip angles (CSDA) and
   different MOFs. A rock slope at a hydropower station in China is used as
   a case study to illustrate the use of the developed procedure. The slope
   has six sets of discontinuities. Therefore, both deterministic and
   probabilistic block theory analyses were conducted for 4-plane, 5-plane,
   6-plane and 7-plane blocks to study the stability of the rock slope
   under different MOFs and CSDA. For most MOFs, the MSSA obtained through
   deterministic analysis were found to be significantly higher than the
   CSDA obtained corresponding to zero instability cumulative probability.
   The differences obtained between the deterministic and probabilistic
   analyses resulted mainly due to the variability of discontinuity
   orientation. The case study illustrated the importance and superiority
   of the probabilistic analysis over the deterministic analysis. For the
   investigated rock slope by selecting the CSDA of 40 and 50, the total
   instability cumulative probability can be limited to less than 5\% and
   10\%, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For the interconnected power system with large-scale wind power, the
   problem of the small signal stability has become the bottleneck of
   restricting the sending-out of wind power as well as the security and
   stability of the whole power system. Around this issue, this paper
   establishes a small signal stability region boundary model of the
   interconnected power system with large-scale wind power based on
   catastrophe theory, providing a new method for analyzing the small
   signal stability. Firstly, we analyzed the typical characteristics and
   the mathematic model of the interconnected power system with wind power
   and pointed out that conventional methods can't directly identify the
   topological properties of small signal stability region boundaries. For
   this problem, adopting catastrophe theory, we established a small signal
   stability region boundary model of the interconnected power system with
   large-scale wind power in two-dimensional power injection space and
   extended it to multiple dimensions to obtain the boundary model in
   multidimensional power injection space. Thirdly, we analyzed
   qualitatively the topological property's changes of the small signal
   stability region boundary caused by large-scale wind power integration.
   Finally, we built simulation models by DIgSILENT/PowerFactory software
   and the final simulation results verified the correctness and
   effectiveness of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{Controversy surrounds the green credentials of hydroelectricity because
   of the potentially large emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) from
   associated reservoirs. However, limited and patchy data particularly for
   China is constraining the current global assessment of GHG releases from
   hydroelectric reservoirs. This study provides the first evaluation of
   the CO2 and CH4 emissions from China's hydroelectric reservoirs by
   considering the reservoir water surface and drawdown areas, and
   downstream sources (including spillways and turbines, as well as river
   downstream). The total emission of 29.6 Tg CO2/year and 0.47 Tg CH4/year
   from hydroelectric reservoirs in China, expressed as CO2 equivalents
   (eq), corresponds to 45.6 Tg CO(2)eq/year, which is 2-fold higher than
   the current GHG emission (ca. 23 Tg CO(2)eq/year) from global temperate
   hydropower reservoirs. China's average emission of 70 g CO(2)eq/kWh from
   hydropower amounts to 7 \% of the emissions from coal-fired plant
   alternatives. China's hydroelectric reservoirs thus currently mitigate
   GHG emission when compared to the main alternative source of electricity
   with potentially far great reductions in GHG emissions and benefits
   possible through relatively minor changes to reservoir management and
   design. On average, the sum of drawdown and downstream emission
   including river reaches below dams and turbines, which is overlooked by
   most studies, represents the equivalent of 42 \% of the CO2 and 92 \% of
   CH4 that emit from hydroelectric reservoirs in China. Main drivers on
   GHG emission rates are summarized and highlight that water depth and
   stratification control CH4 flux, and CO2 flux shows significant negative
   relationships with pH, DO, and Chl-a. Based on our finding, a
   substantial revision of the global carbon emissions from hydroelectric
   reservoirs is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Small hydropower projects (SHPs), though generally considered more
   environmentally benign and socially acceptable as compared to large
   projects, yet their overall sustainability is under suspicion in the
   Himalayan regions. Almost all SHPs in this region are being developed as
   run of the river mode which generally causes less/no submergence and
   quite less displacement of people as compared to large reservoir based
   hydropower production mode. However, in the absence of proper planning
   and monitoring mechanism, these projects are causing implacable
   tunnelling of hills, choking of streams, conversion of streams into dry
   ditches and long term socio-environmental impacts. This paper presents a
   SHP development study from hydro rich Beas river basin of Himachal
   Pradesh, a state nestled in western Himalayan region of India. In depth
   field studies, focus group discussions with the project affected people
   and interaction with project proponents of five SHPs in this region
   suggest that sustainability issues with respect to SHPs are not small
   vis-a-vis size of their installed capacity. There is an urgent need to
   take steps to include SHPs having an installed capacity of above 10 MW
   into the ambit of environment clearance process which is absent in many
   countries of the world at present. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
