Abstract = {{This paper documents version 1 of the Finite-volume Atmospheric Model of
   the IAP/LASG (FAMIL1), which has a flexible horizontal resolution up to
   a quarter of 1 degrees. The model, currently running on the ``Tianhe
   1A{''} supercomputer, is the atmospheric component of the
   third-generation Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land climate System
   model (FGOALS3) which will participate in the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). In addition to describing the
   dynamical core and physical parameterizations of FAMIL1, this paper
   describes the simulated characteristics of energy and water balances and
   compares them with observational/reanalysis data. The comparisons
   indicate that the model simulates well the seasonal and geographical
   distributions of radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and at
   the surface, as well as the surface latent and sensible heat fluxes. A
   major weakness in the energy balance is identified in the regions where
   extensive and persistent marine stratocumulus is present. Analysis of
   the global water balance also indicates realistic seasonal and
   geographical distributions with the global annual mean of evaporation
   minus precipitation being approximately 10(-5) mm d(-1). We also examine
   the connections between the global energy and water balance and discuss
   the possible link between the two within the context of the findings
   from the reanalysis data. Finally, the model biases as well as possible
   solutions are discussed.}},

   water heating in the United States}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Volume = {{81}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Water heating represented nearly 13\% of 2010 residential energy
   consumption making it an important target for energy conservation
   efforts. The objective of this work is to identify spatially-resolved
   strategies for energy conservation, since little analysis has been done
   to identify how regional characteristics affect the energy consumed for
   water heating. We present a first-order thermodynamic analysis,
   utilizing ab initio calculations and regression methods, to quantify
   primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions with regional specificity
   by considering by considering local electricity mixes, heat rates, solar
   radiation profiles, heating degrees days, and water heating unit sales
   for 27 regions of the US. Results suggest that shifting from electric
   towards natural gas or solar water heating offered primary energy and
   CO2 emission reductions in most US regions, but these reductions varied
   considerably according to regional electricity mix and solar resources.
   We find that regions that would benefit most from technology
   transitions, are often least likely to switch due to limited economic
   incentives. Our results suggest that federal energy factor metrics,
   which ignore upstream losses in power generation, are insufficient in
   informing consumers about the energy performance of residential end use
   appliances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the Loess Plateau, one of the world's most seriously eroded regions

   lutarioriparius produced the highest biomass and had the highest
   photosynthetic rates (A), with the growing-season average of A reaching
   nearly 20 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Native to JH, M. lutarioriparius
   maintained a relatively high photosynthetic rate into the late growing
   stage in QG, for example, 15 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at temperature as low as
   11.6 degrees C in October. All three species had higher water use
   efficiency (WUE) in semiarid QG than in warmer and wetter JH. In the
   late growing stage of M. lutarioriparius, instantaneous WUE (A/E) of the
   species nearly tripled in QG comparing to JH. Being able to maintain

Abstract = {{In operating a complex hydroelectric system in a competitive market the
   operational as well as the financial risks are high. Decision makers and

   Traditionally the main objective of the system operator was to secure a
   stable supply of electric power to meet the local system load demand
   while meeting the system physical and operational constraints. The major
   driving force in making operating decisions was to ensure the
   availability of sufficient energy and capacity to meet the system demand

   constraints. This article presents Decision support system (DSS) under
   Availability Based Tariff Regime for operation, scheduling and

   engineers in order to improve the operational efficiency of the Sewa

Abstract = {{Water and energy are important resources for regional economies and are
   inextricably and reciprocally linked. Global water and energy demand
   will increase significantly by 2030 while climate change will worsen
   water availability. Thus, it is important to ensure a sustainable energy
   supply despite the increasing severity of water resource constraints.
   Numerous studies have analyzed water requirements to produce energy from
   production perspectives. However, energy is generally supplied by both
   internal and external producers. Thus, it is necessary to consider the
   availability of water to produce energy from consumption perspectives
   also. We evaluate the water footprint of the energy supply of Liaoning
   Province, China. We apply the standard top-down approach using an
   input-output framework. We estimate the water footprint of the energy
   supply of Liaoning Province at 854 million m(3) in 2002, with 47\% of
   water used for electricity and heating. Our results reveal that energy
   supply could depend on water resources in neighboring provinces;
   external producers met 80\% of the water footprint of energy supply,
   although only 35\% of energy supply was imported. If Liaoning Province
   decreased its external dependency, withdrawal of available water
   resources within the province would increase from 86\% to 91\%. To
   guarantee future regional energy security, it is important to manage
   water resources effectively through water-efficient electricity
   generation and by allocating water resources among sectors. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Reliable regional climate projections need improved
   land-surface-atmosphere models in which land-surface exchange, in
   particular the role of the vegetation, is well represented. To get a
   better understanding of the land-surface exchange and as a data basis

   eddy-covariance measurements were performed over agricultural landscapes
   in two regions of Southwest Germany with different regional climate:
   near the northern Upper Rhine Valley with a mild climate and on the
   Swabian Jura, a low mountain range plateau where the climate is colder
   and wetter. At each study site we installed three eddy-covariance
   weather stations and monitored the soil water regime as well as the crop
   development. We describe the characteristics of the study sites, the
   experimental field work and data processing. The dynamics of water vapor
   and energy fluxes over winter wheat, winter oilseed rape and silage
   maize were evaluated for the time period from 2009 to 2011. The accuracy
   of the measured energy and matter fluxes limited by statistics and
   instrumental noise error was better than 10\%. Energy fluxes and albedo
   were closely linked to crop development. The albedo increased and
   decreased with LAI. Albedo values up to 0.28 were measured over
   flowering oilseed rape. The winter crops developed faster in the milder
   climate. The daily average of latent heat flux was about 10-20 Wm(-2)
   higher and that of sensible heat flux about 5-15 Wm(-2) lower there in
   comparison with the colder climate. Differences between both regions
   with regard to the turbulent fluxes are assigned to be mainly due to
   differences in vapor pressure deficit. Actual and prevailing weather
   conditions had a large impact on energy fluxes so that notable
   differences of flux dynamics were observed not only between the regions
   but also at one site for the same crop in different years. The observed
   long-term flux dynamics are discussed with respect to phenology,
   regional climate and the impact of prevailing weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable biomass can play a transformative role in the transition to
   a decarbonized economy, with potential applications in electricity,
   heat, chemicals and transportation fuels(1-3). Deploying bioenergy with
   carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) results in a net reduction in
   atmospheric carbon. BECCS may be one of the few cost-effective
   carbon-negative opportunities available should anthropogenic climate
   change be worse than anticipated or emissions reductions in other
   sectors prove particularly difficult(4,5). Previous work, primarily
   using integrated assessment models, has identified the critical role of
   BECCS in long-term (pre- or post-2100 time frames) climate change
   mitigation, but has not investigated the role of BECCS in power systems
   in detail, or in aggressive time frames(6,7), even though
   commercial-scale facilities are starting to be deployed in the
   transportation sector(8). Here, we explore the economic and deployment
   implications for BECCS in the electricity system of western North
   America under aggressive (pre-2050) time frames and carbon emissions
   limitations, with rich technology representation and physical
   constraints. We show that BECCS, combined with aggressive renewable
   deployment and fossil-fuel emission reductions, can enable a
   carbon-negative power system in western North America by 2050 with up to
   145\% emissions reduction from 1990 levels. In most scenarios, the
   offsets produced by BECCS are found to be more valuable to the power
   system than the electricity it provides. Advanced biomass power
   generation employs similar system design to advanced coal technology,
   enabling a transition strategy to low-carbon energy.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of ``small hydro{''} power generation in Europe is still
   largely unexploited because of strict environmental requirements and
   legal rights for water use. Among the EU-27 member states, Italy is
   recognised as one of the most promising countries for the further
   exploitation of small hydro power.
   This paper presents a methodology for assessing the technical and
   economic potential of small hydro on a regional scale. The methodology
   is applied to the Abruzzo region in Italy. The investigation covers
   approximately 90 river branches belonging to the major regional basins.
   The methodology characterises the flow duration curves of suitable
   stretches of river using a regional analysis based on a graphical
   approach.
   An energy model evaluates the rated power and the annual electricity
   production of installable small-hydro power plants based on the flow
   duration curve and the type of hydraulic turbine. The economic analysis
   estimates the unit cost of electricity produced and the profitability of
   the initial investment assuming two scenarios based on different fixed-
   and variable-cost models. The net potential obtained from the energy
   analysis is adjusted to give the economically feasible potential at
   different levels of economic competitiveness for the regional basins

   yet to be extensively grounded, however, into national policies and

   stated aspirations for sustainable development and poverty reduction,
   then it should engage more directly in identifying winners and losers in
   natural resource decision-making, the politics involved, and ultimately
   with the issue of justice. In order to do so, it links the nexus to the

   matrix. After reducing the matrix by principal component analysis, the
   matrix has been reconstructed including the kinematics fragments and the
   corresponding principal component score. The 13660 kinematics fragments
   were divided into three categories by fuzzy C-means clustering. On this
   basis, abnormal data were removed by Pauta criterion. Then according to
   the characteristic parameter of kinematic eigenvalues, a model on engine

Title = {{Projecting changes in annual hydropower generation using regional runoff
   data: An assessment of the United States federal hydropower plants}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Abstract = {{Federal hydropower plants account for approximately half of installed US
   conventional hydropower capacity, and are an important part of the
   national renewable energy portfolio. Utilizing the strong linear
   relationship between the US Geological Survey WaterWatch runoff and
   annual hydropower generation, a runoff-based assessment approach is
   introduced in this study to project changes in annual and regional
   hydropower generation in multiple power marketing areas. Future climate
   scenarios are developed with a series of global and regional climate
   models, and the model output is bias-corrected to be consistent with
   observed data for the recent past. Using this approach, the median
   change in annual generation at federal projects is projected to be -2
   TWh, with an estimated ensemble uncertainty of +/- 9 TWh. Although these
   estimates are similar to the recently observed variability in annual
   hydropower generation, and may therefore appear to be manageable,
   significantly seasonal runoff changes are projected and it may pose
   significant challenges in water systems with higher limits on reservoir
   storage and operational flexibility. Future assessments will be improved
   by incorporating next-generation climate models, by closer examination
   of extreme events and longer-term change, and by addressing the
   interactions among hydropower and other water uses. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a case study of the changes in the
   hydrogeotechnical behavior of a portion of the foundation block of the
   Itaipu Dam, which is located on the Parana River on the border between
   Brazil and Paraguay. The study focuses on the foundation buttress blocks
   of the Right Buttress Dam, where the most permeable regions of the
   massif are monitored by standpipe piezometers. The behaviors of two
   features within the basalt layers, a basaltic breccia and a fracture,
   were evaluated. In general, the uplift pressure distribution models of
   the foundations of concrete dams only consider the hydraulic loads
   caused by the presence of the reservoir and the tail-water elevation.
   However, this study demonstrates that the hydrogeotechnical behavior of
   the massif in a given period may also depend on the local variation in
   rainfall. The primary conclusion is that although the rocky massif has
   received several foundation treatments (waterproofing and drainage
   work), the natural hydraulic conditions of the massif govern the
   pressure variations within the monitored features. Studying the behavior
   of these features is of fundamental importance to all large concrete
   dams, as a statistical analysis of ruptures in several types of dams
   conducted by the International Commission on Large Dams has demonstrated
   that accidents involving this type of dam are primarily caused by
   foundation collapse, particularly by collapses related to internal
   erosion problems and low shear resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The Himalaya is known for its rich biodiversity, and it supports the
   Indian subcontinent with wide varieties of natural resources including
   the life-sustaining water. Its huge potential to develop
   micro-hydropower projects is untapped. Large-scale multi-purpose river
   valley projects are not feasible as the landscape of Garhwal region is
   highly vulnerable-ecologically fragile, geologically unstable and
   tectonically and seismically active. Here, the issues of landscape
   vulnerability and rehabilitation, due to the construction of hydropower
   projects, are renowned. In Garhwal region, the hydropower projects,
   which have been constructed and are under construction and proposed, are
   located in the densely populated river valleys, where terraced arable
   land is also available. These areas are highly prone to atmospherically
   triggered hazards-debris flows, flash floods, landslides, mass movements
   and rockfalls. Rehabilitation of the affected population has been
   remaining as a major challenge in all the river valley projects from the
   very onset of the commencement of hydropower projects in Garhwal region.
   This paper examines the landscape vulnerability and rehabilitation
   issues related to the hydropower projects in Garhwal region, Himalaya.
   The author collected the data from the primary and secondary sources and
   from the rapid field visits of the hydropower project sites. This study
   reveals that only micro-level hydropower projects are feasible in the
   fragile landscape of the Garhwal Himalaya, keeping vulnerability and

Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{43-55}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{With a huge energy demand, the small hydropower (SHP) has undertaken a
   rapid development in the past six decades in China. Especially in the
   recent three decades, the increasing environmental pressure has promoted
   its development rate and the significance of its management and
   operation. The number of SHP stations in China has exceeded 45,000 with
   a total installed capacity of more than 68 GW, ranked the first in the
   world. SHP provides approximately 5\% of China's gross electricity
   generation and is the major backbone for rural electrification. However,
   how to manage and operate SHP effectively is still a difficult problem
   in China. In this paper, the current status of SHP in China is
   investigated. A special emphasis is given to their dispatching
   management. The southwestern province of Yunnan, ranked second in
   exploitable potential and first in established capacity of SHP in China,
   is taken as a typical example for the management and operation of SHP.
   The difficulties and challenges of management and operation of SHP in
   Yunnan province are depicted. A case system for the SHP management in
   Yunnan is introduced in details. It is believed that the system should
   be beneficial for regions with rich SHP resources in China and elsewhere

   River, China}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{476-487}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The Jinsha River is the third longest river in the world. It consists of
   four large hydropower stations with total installed capacity 42,960 MW
   lying on the upper stretches of the Yangtze River, which is the longest
   river in the word. Due to the great potential of large cascade
   hydropower stations on power generation, long-term scheduling of large
   cascade hydropower stations (LSLCHS) plays an important role in
   electrical power system. As more and more concentrations focused on the
   optimal operation of large cascade hydropower stations, the LSLCHS has
   been taken into a multi-dimensional, non-convex and non-linear
   optimization problem due to its complicated hydraulic connection
   relationships and varieties of complex constraints with considering its
   power generation, shipping and ecological characteristics. In order to
   solve this problem, a multi-population ant colony optimization for
   continuous domain (MACO(R)) is proposed in this paper. A Gaussian group
   selection strategy is applied to overcome premature convergence and ants
   with different characteristics are employed to enhance search ability,
   and circulatory solution correction strategy is presented to handle
   outflow, water level and output constraints. Furthermore, the efficiency
   and stability of MACO(R) are verified by its more desirable results in
   comparison to other latest works in numerical simulation, and it can be
   a viable alternative for solving those complicated optimal problems.
   With the applications in hydropower operation, LSLCHS can obtain more
   power generation benefit than other alternatives in dry, normal and wet
   year, and the compensation analysis reveals that joint operation of
   cascade hydropowerstations can enhance the total power generation
   especially in wet season. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The water-energy-food nexus is a concept increasingly being used with
   reference to integrated decision-making across sectors. Action in one
   area will impact one or both of the other areas. Sustainable development
   and growth can be achieved by better management of the world's
   ecosystems and a more strategic use of water, land and other natural
   resources. Water, energy and food resources are not spread evenly across
   the Southern African Development Community (SADC) resulting in an
   imbalance in endowments. Opportunities exist in sharing the benefits of
   particular resources across international boundaries for the benefit of
   the region and to optimize resource use. This paper considers each
   sector, investigating the current institutional support for integration
   and evidence of such integration taking place. Broadening the lens of
   integrated and regional resources planning in SADC may increase the
   resilience of the region and optimize the use of limited natural
   resources. Barriers to using the nexus at a regional scale tend to
   include the power of sovereignty over regional policies in addition to
   the physical challenges of managing resources over a large area. (C)

Abstract = {{For better prediction and understanding of land-atmospheric interaction,
   in-situ observed meteorological data acquired from the China
   Meteorological Administration (CMA) were assimilated in the Weather
   Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the monthly Green Vegetation
   Coverage (GVF) data, which was calculated using the Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the Earth Observing System
   Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (EOS-MODIS) and Digital
   Elevation Model (DEM) data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
   (SRTM) system. Furthermore, the WRF model produced a High-Resolution
   Assimilation Dataset of the water-energy cycle in China (HRADC). This
   dataset has a horizontal resolution of 25 km for near surface
   meteorological data, such as air temperature, humidity, wind vectors and
   pressure (19 levels); soil temperature and moisture (four levels);
   surface temperature; downward/upward short/long radiation; 3-h latent
   heat flux; sensible heat flux; and ground heat flux. In this study, we
   1) briefly introduce the cycling 3D-Var assimilation method and 2)
   compare results of meteorological elements, such as 2 m temperature and
   precipitation generated by the HRADC with the gridded observation data
   from CMA, and surface temperature and specific humidity with Global Land
   Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) output data from the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). We find that the simulated
   results of monthly 2 m temperature from HRADC is improved compared with
   the control simulation and has effectively reproduced the observed
   patterns. The simulated special distribution of ground surface
   temperature and specific humidity from HRADC are much closer to GLDAS
   outputs. The spatial distribution of root mean square errors (RMSE) and
   bias of 2 m temperature between observations and HRADC is reduced
   compared with the bias between observations and the control run. The
   monthly spatial distribution of surface temperature and specific
   humidity from HRADC is consistent with the GLDAS outputs over China.
   This study could improve the land surface parameters by utilizing remote
   sensing data and could further improve atmospheric elements with a data
   assimilation system. This work provides an effective attempt at
   combining multi-source data with different spatial and temporal scales
   into numerical simulations, and the simulated results could be used in
   further research on the long-term climatic effects and characteristics
   of the water-energy cycle over China. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{112-122}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The belief that small hydropower (SHP) systems are sources of clean
   energy with few or no ecological problems has been driving the rapid
   expansion of SHP plants in China and elsewhere. This paper presents an
   evaluation of the ecological impacts of SHP based on an emergy analysis
   of a plant located in Guizhou Province in southwest China. The results
   suggest that periodic downstream drying-up of the river is the largest
   contributor to the induced ecological impacts in terms of emergy cost.
   In 2010, the ecosystem service losses caused by downstream ecosystem
   degradation totaled 235E+18 seJ, which accounts for 38\% of the total
   emergy utilized in the annual operation of this plant. If such losses
   could be avoided, i.e., if the SHP operated as designed, SHP projects
   would produce relatively modest impacts on the environment. When the
   reaches downstream of the SHP plant are not affected, the environmental
   loading ratio (ELR) is 2.20 and the emergy sustainability index (ESI) is
   0.93; however, the ELR increases to 3.82 and ESI decreases to 0.38 when
   river drying-up occurs. These results indicate that China should
   rigorously investigate potential ecological problems of SHP development
   and proceed with caution rather than readily believing unjustified

   surrounding rock damage severity. The new criteria classified the rock
   burst intensity into five levels: extremely intense, intense, moderate,
   weak, and none, and the common logarithms of the radiated energy of each

   Over all 50 states, converting would provide similar to 3.9 million
   40-year construction jobs and similar to 2.0 million 40-year operation
   jobs for the energy facilities alone, the sum of which would outweigh
   the similar to 3.9 million jobs lost in the conventional energy sector.
   Converting would also eliminate similar to 62000 (19000-115000) U.S. air
   pollution premature mortalities per year today and similar to 46000
   (12000-104000) in 2050, avoiding similar to\$600 (\$85-\$2400) bil. per
   year (2013 dollars) in 2050, equivalent to similar to 3.6 (0.5-14.3)
   percent of the 2014 U.S. gross domestic product. Converting would
   further eliminate similar to\$3.3 (1.9-7.1) tril. per year in 2050
   global warming costs to the world due to U.S. emissions. These plans
   will result in each person in the U.S. in 2050 saving similar to\$260
   (190-320) per year in energy costs (\$2013 dollars) and U.S. health and
   global climate costs per person decreasing by similar to\$1500
   (210-6000) per year and similar to\$8300 (4700-17600) per year,
   respectively. The new footprint over land required will be similar to
   0.42\% of U.S. land. The spacing area between wind turbines, which can
   be used for multiple purposes, will be similar to 1.6\% of U.S. land.
   Thus, 100\% conversions are technically and economically feasible with
   little downside. These roadmaps may therefore reduce social and
   political barriers to implementing clean-energy policies.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The chapter attempts to evaluate the utility of applying
   multi-level governance outside of the EU , and also outside of the group
   of democratic states, to states that have defied the third wave of
   democratization and that are characterized by a so-called new
   authoritarianism. The case is the People's Republic of China, and the
   focus falls on policy-making and implementation in the field of
   hydropower with special attention to the issue area of environmental
   protection.
   Methodology/approach - The chapter draws on the notion of scales and
   indigenous Chinese governance concepts and brings these into a
   conversation with the concept of multi-level governance. Case studies on
   hydropower decision-making in China contribute empirical data in order
   to investigate the utility of multi-level governance in the Chinese
   governance context.
   Findings - The chapter argues that if multi-level governance is to have
   utility in other cultural contexts it needs to move away from a
   consideration of pre-given scales as locus of authority and consider
   indigenous governance concepts and notions of scale, and it crucially
   needs to map power relationships in the making and implementation of
   policies in order to reach analytical depth.
   Research implications - The case of China shows that authoritarian
   regimes can be analysed in terms of multiple levels as authoritarianism
   no longer automatically implies strict top-down entities. Instead,
   autocracies can be highly fragmented and subject to complex
   decision-making processes that can arise during processes of
   administrative reform. This can lead to vibrant and reflexive systems of
   governance that exhibit adaptive skills necessary to ensure regime
   survival amidst a continuously diversifying society and changing
   external circumstances. As a consequence, a research programme looking
   at the new authoritarianism from a multi-level governance perspective
   has the capacity to uncover and describe new forms of governance, by
   bringing the concept into a conversation with indigenous governance
   concepts.
   Practical implications - In China, informal networks between the energy
   bureaucracy and hydropower developers determine the hydropower
   decision-making process. This is particularly detrimental at a time when
   the Chinese government emphasizes the importance of the rule of law and
   social stability. Informal networks in which key government agencies are
   involved actively thwart the attempt of creating reliable institutions
   and more transparent and accountable processes of decision-making within
   the authoritarian governance framework.
   Social implications - The findings show the dominance of informal
   networks versus the formal decision-making process. This sidelines the
   environmental bureaucracy and fails to fully realize the importance of
   public input into the decision-making process as one potential element
   of institutionalized conflict resolution.
   Originality/value - The chapter builds on existing multi-level
   governance approaches and fuses them with notions of scales and
   indigenous Chinese governance concepts in order to enable the
   applicability of the concept of multi-level governance outside of its
   area of origin. This advances the explanatory depth and theoretical
   reach of multi-level governance.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that there are huge land use and land cover changes
   (LUCC) all over the world in recent decades, and plenty of ensuing
   effect appeared on the energy and water balance. This study aims to
   analyze the impacts of land use and land cover changes on the energy and
   water balance in the Heihe River Basin of China during 2000-2010, and
   four key study sites with representative hydrological stations and
   dramatic LUCC in the past decades were selected to illustrate the
   responses of the energy and water balance to LUCC. First, LUCC of the
   Heihe River Basin from 2000 to 2010 was analyzed based on the
   interpretation of remote sensing images. Then a series of indicators of
   the energy and water balances were simulated with the Weather Research
   and Forecasting (WRF) model and corresponding land use and land cover
   data. Thereafter the impacts of LUCC on the surface energy and water
   balance were detected and analyzed. The spatial-temporal variance of the
   impacts of LUCC on energy and water balance in a typical arid inland
   river basin was specifically presented in following analysis. The
   results show that different land use/cover conversions result in various
   energy balances. During this process, the most significant impacts on
   surface energy balance occurred when grassland was converted to barren
   or sparsely vegetated land. As for water balance, the impact is measured
   with variations of precipitation, runoff and evapotranspiration induced
   by LUCC, which were also remarkable, although seasonal trends of the
   effects are similar among various land use/cover conversions during
   2000-2010. At last, policy suggestions, e.g., shifting the water balance
   by LUCC to improve the water management are given to conclude this
   study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the nexus between water use and energy supply in
   Brazil by comparing the ``requirements{''} of water inputs of different
   energy systems to the quantities of energy carriers they generate. An
   effective quantitative analysis of the water requirements of the energy
   sector requires an epistemological discussion of how to account for its
   ``water inputs{''}. In fact, different energy systems ``use{''} water
   differently and this heterogeneity of water uses is not covered by the
   traditional classifications of water uses. In order to handle the
   existing ambiguity in the accounting of water we use an innovative
   method called the Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and
   Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) for dealing with the water-energy nexus.
   The MuSIASEM approach provides an integrated set of categories of
   accounting that can be used for the calculation of an Environmental
   Impact Matrix, avoiding potential confusion. In order to make possible
   the operationalization of this information into an Environmental Impact
   Matrix (to gain policy relevance), the information is: (i) organized in
   relation to different types of water use in different types of power
   plants (the expected characteristics of each type of technology); (ii)
   scaled in relation to the actual use in Brazil (how much of each type is
   in use).}},

Abstract = {{A case study on a desert-oasis wetland ecosystem in the arid region of
   Northwest China measured the seasonal and interannual variation in
   energy partitioning and evapotranspiration to analyse the response of
   water and energy exchange on soil moisture, groundwater, and
   environmental variables. Energy partitioning showed a clear seasonal and
   interannual variability, and the process of water and energy exchange
   differed significantly in the monthly and interannual scales. The net
   radiation was 7.31 MJ m(-2).day(-1), and sensible heat flux accounted
   for 50.42\% of net radiation in energy fluxes, 40.56\% for latent heat
   flux, and 9.02\% for ground heat flux. The parameters in energy fluxes
   were best described by a unimodal curve, whereas sensible heat flux
   followed a bimodal curve. Variations in the daily evapotranspiration and
   crop evapotranspiration also exhibited a single peak curve with annual
   values of 569.84 and 644.47 mm, respectively. Canopy conductance
   averaged 20.77 +/- 13.75 mm s(-1) and varied from 0.16 to 83.96 mm s(-1)
   during the two hydrological years. The variation in water and energy
   exchange reflected environmental conditions and depended primarily on
   vapour pressure deficit, net radiation, soil moisture, and water depth.
   Although the effects of precipitation on evapotranspiration showed that
   the response of this ecosystem to climate changes was not obvious, the
   variation of air temperatures had a strong influence on
   evapotranspiration, resulting in a significant increase in
   evapotranspiration (R = 0.730; P < 0.01). Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Irrigated agriculture constitutes the largest consumer of freshwater in
   the Mediterranean region and provides a major source of income and
   employment for rural livelihoods. However, increasing droughts and water
   scarcity have highlighted concerns regarding the environmental
   sustainability of agriculture in the region. An integrated assessment
   combining a gridded water balance model with a geodatabase and GIS has
   been developed and used to assess the water demand and energy footprint
   of irrigated production in the region. Modelled outputs were linked with
   crop yield and water resources data to estimate water (m(3) kg(-1)) and
   energy (CO2 kg(-1)) productivity and identify vulnerable areas or
   `hotspots'. For a selected key crops in the region, irrigation accounts
   for 61 km(3) yr(-1) of water abstraction and 1.78 Gt CO2 emissions yr-1,
   with most emissions from sunflower (73 kg CO2/t) and cotton (60 kg
   CO2/t) production. Wheat is a major strategic crop in the region and was
   estimated to have a water productivity of 1000 tMm(-3) and emissions of
   31 kg CO2/t. Irrigation modernization would save around 8 km(3) of water
   but would correspondingly increase CO2 emissions by around +135\%.
   Shifting from rain-fed to irrigated production would increase irrigation
   demand to 166 km(3) yr(-1) (+137\%) whilst CO2 emissions would rise by
   +270\%. The study has major policy implications for understanding the
   water-energy-food nexus in the region and the trade-offs between
   strategies to save water, reduce CO2 emissions and/or intensify food
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from hydropower reservoirs
   have been of great concerns recently, yet the significant carbon

Abstract = {{South Africa is an arid country, where water supply is often obtained
   from a distant source. There is increasing pressure on the limited water
   resources due to economic and population growth, with a concomitant
   increase in the energy requirement for water production. This problem
   will be exacerbated by the onset of climate change. Recently, there have
   been concerns about negative impacts arising from the exploitation of
   energy resources. In particular, the burning of fossil fuels is
   significantly contributing to climate change through the emission of
   carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. In addition, fossil fuels are
   being depleted, and contributing to decreased energy security. As a
   result of this, the international community has initiated various
   interventions, including the transformation of policy and regulatory
   instruments, to promote sustainable energy. With this in mind, South
   Africa is making policy and regulatory shifts in line with international
   developments. Renewable energy is being promoted as one way of achieving
   sustainable energy provision in the country. However, some issues
   require scrutiny in order to understand the water footprint of renewable
   energy production. Due to the large gap that exists between water supply
   and demand, trade-offs in water allocation amongst different users are
   critical. In this vein, the main objective of this study was to
   investigate and review renewable energy choices and water requirements
   in South Africa. Data were acquired through a combination of a desktop
   study and expert interviews. Water withdrawal and consumption levels at
   a given stage of energy production were investigated. Most of the data
   was collected from secondary sources. Results show that there is limited
   data on all aspects of water usage in the production chain of energy,
   accounting in part for the significant variations in the values of water
   intensity that are reported in the literature. It is vital to take into
   account all aspects of the energy life cycle to enable isolation of
   stages where significant amounts of water are used. It is found that
   conventional fuels (nuclear and fossil fuels) withdraw significant
   quantities of water over the life-cycle of energy production, especially
   for thermoelectric power plants operated with a wet-cooling system. The
   quality of water is also adversely affected in some stages of energy
   production from these fuels. On the other hand, solar photovoltaic and
   wind energy exhibit the lowest demand for water, and could perhaps be
   considered the most viable renewable options in terms of water
   withdrawal and consumption.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel methodology for constructing wide area
   thermal security region (WATSR) to monitor the wide area thermal
   security of bulk power system under N-1 criterion by utilizing wide area
   measurement system. A general cutset angle for large-scale inter-area
   power system is defined and developed as a measurement to assess the
   system thermal security so as to construct WATSR in cutset-angle space.
   WATSR consists of all stable operating points under N-1 criterion, while
   its boundary is a complete set of all the critical points. In this
   paper, the boundary of WATSR is represented via its piecewise
   approximation with a set of hyperplanes to enhance the calculating
   speed. Hyperplanes are described as a set of linear equalities, which
   are convenient to be determined. And, because coefficients of a
   hyperplane can indicate the sensitivities between various control
   parameters, it is beneficial to power system online security assessment
   and control strategy optimization. A two-step algorithm is given to
   apply WATSR to online monitoring for bulk power system. The first step
   is offline calculation. The aim of this step is to determine a minimum
   set of hyperplanes to properly describe the boundary of WATSR. A
   hyperplane is a sub-segment of the security region boundary and normally
   corresponds to a certain constraint. The second step is online matching.
   Data retrieved from wide area measurement system are used to determine
   the relative constraints given by the hyperplanes. And then, the
   stability of the system can be quickly and accurately determined by the
   assistance of WATSR result. Once the power system turns to critical,
   WATSR can help the operators to optimize their control strategy. The
   methodology of WATSR has been successfully implemented in the China
   Southern Power Grid, which is known as one of the largest alternating
   current/direct current parallel transmission system in the world.
   Feasibility and effectiveness of the presented method have been
   validated through intensive analyses in China Southern Power Grid.

Abstract = {{Dam construction and reservoir formation represent profound
   anthropogenic alterations to natural riverscapes, especially in terms of
   connectivity in migratory fishes. The Peace River in northeastern
   British Columbia (BC), Canada, is the largest river system in BC, home
   to 39 native fishes and currently has two major hydroelectric projects,
   and a third one (Site C') is proposed. Three co-distributed and
   migratory fishes, the bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), Arctic
   grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and the mountain whitefish (Prosopium
   williamsoni) are key species in the Peace River ecologically and in
   terms of recreational fisheries. We examined microsatellite DNA
   variation in these species to assess genetic diversity, levels of
   population subdivision and connectivity to better understand potential
   impacts and to provide baseline information for subsequent monitoring.
   Expected heterozygosity and number of alleles averaged 0.65 and 7.7,
   0.73 and 11.9, and 0.72 and 10.8 for bull trout (nine loci), Arctic
   grayling (10 loci) and mountain whitefish (10 loci), respectively.
   Estimates of the effective number of breeders (N-b) ranged from 35 to
   255 for bull trout to over 3700 for Arctic grayling. Population
   subdivision (F-ST, ) was 0.040, 0.063 and 0.023 in bull trout, Arctic
   grayling and mountain whitefish, respectively (all p < 0.001). Temporal
   differences within localities for all species accounted for < 1\% of
   total variation in allele frequencies. An estimated 6.2\% (mountain
   whitefish), 4.6\% (bull trout) and 8.8\% (Arctic grayling) of fish
   samples were inferred (p < 0.05) to be immigrants to one locality from
   another locality. Our results suggest that connectivity amongst
   localities is important to successful completion of the life history of
   each species, the potential disruption of which will be a critical
   aspect of post-development monitoring. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \&

Title = {{Benthic macroinvertebrate flow sensitivity as a tool to assess effects

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Within Canada, hydro-electric power is the leading source of energy for
   households and industry. It is thus critical to understand and minimize
   its ecological impacts, by developing management guidelines for
   hydropower operations. Flow peaking is a common practice at
   hydroelectric facilities as hydropower generation often tracks the
   demand in electricity, and understanding its ecological impacts is key
   to developing sustainable river management guidelines. Based on standard
   macroinvertebrate biomonitoring data, the Canadian Ecological Flow Index
   (CEFI) is a tool to assess flow sensitivity based on Canadian rivers.
   Having already demonstrated its utility to detect changes in flow
   conditions, CEFI was applied in this study to investigate the ecological
   effects of altering a peaking hydropower scheme, specifically by
   changing the ramping rate, or the rate of change of flow from minimum to
   maximum and back in a peaking cycle. Data were collected in two
   proximate rivers in Ontario: one experiencing hydropower ramping and the
   other with a natural flow regime, allowing the detection of the effects
   unlimited ramping using a BACI (Before-After/Control-Impact) design. In
   the regulated river, the first two years of the study were subjected to
   restricted ramping rate practices while unlimited ramping was permitted
   thereafter. Hydrological data were collected at each station and used to
   compute a series of 33 Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) metrics
   to characterize the ecohydrological condition of the river systems. The
   benthic community responded to changes in ramping rate and CEFI was able
   to discriminate the alteration signal and to diagnose the impact.
   Hydrological descriptors of the effects of the ramping activities were
   clear drivers of the CEFI variation in the hydropower-ramping site. This
   study is the first to apply the CEFI approach to a BACI in situ
   experiment. The CEFI tool again proved to be a useful indicator of flow
   alteration, with great promise for its use in the development of
   hydroecological management guidelines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Hydropower is very important for electricity supply security in the
   European inter-connexion as well as for the economy of regions
   (primarily peripheral) that possess water resources. Its future may
   however be jeopardized by several factors: climate change, the
   development of new renewable energy, the creation of super and
   micro-grids, and progress in power storage technology. Energy and
   climate policy, as well as electricity market design and dynamics play a
   pivotal role.
   This article carries out a comprehensive analysis of all these factors
   and discusses the future of hydropower. This discussion follows an
   overview of the present situation and of future drivers. The technical,
   environmental, economic and political aspects of the problem are
   analyzed with an interdisciplinary approach. The stakes as well as the
   uncertainties are highlighted.
   The conclusion is that hydropower has a promising future, particularly
   in light of emerging sustainable energy policy, but that the risks
   should not be overlooked. Academics will find a comprehensive
   interdisciplinary analysis of hydropower in this article, whereas public
   bodies, communities and hydropower companies can identify the strategic
   variables that should be taken into consideration in the decision making
   process. The end of water concessions or authorizations is also evoked.

Abstract = {{For almost two decades, studies have been under way in Brazil, showing
   how hydroelectric reservoirs produce biogenic gases, mainly methane
   (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), through the organic decomposition of
   flooded bio-mass. This somewhat complex phenomenon is due to a set of
   variables with differing levels of interdependence that directly or
   indirectly affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The purpose of this
   paper is to determine, through a statistical data analysis, the relation
   between CO2, CH4 diffusive fluxes and environmental variables at the
   Furnas, Itumbiara and Serra da Mesa hydroelectric reservoirs, located in
   the Cerrado biome on Brazil's high central plateau. The choice of this
   region was prompted by its importance in the national context, covering
   an area of some two million square kilometers, encompassing two major
   river basins (Parana and Tocantins-Araguaia), with the largest installed
   power generation capacity in Brazil, together accounting for around 23\%
   of Brazilian territory. This study shows that CH4 presented a moderate
   negative correlation between CO2 and depth. Additionally, a moderate
   positive correlation was noted for pH, water temperature and wind. The
   CO2 presented a moderate negative correlation for pH, wind speed, water
   temperature and air temperature. Additionally, a moderate positive
   correlation was noted for CO2 and water temperature. The complexity of
   the emission phenomenon is unlikely to occur through a simultaneous
   understanding of all the factors, due to difficulties in accessing and
   analyzing all the variables that have real, direct effects on GHG
   production and emission.}},

Abstract = {{Water scarcity and uneven water distribution pose significant challenges
   to sustainable development and energy production in China. Based on the
   International Energy Agency (IEA)'s energy strategy scenarios for China,
   we evaluated the water withdrawal for energy production from 2011 to
   2030. The results show that the amount of water withdrawal will be
   increased by 77\% in 2030, which will aggravate China's water scarcity
   risk under current energy strategy. We also observed that 67\% of the
   energy production in China occurs in areas that are facing water
   scarcity. Moreover, China's 12th Five-Year Plan of Energy Development
   does not change the existing energy strategies, and the planned total
   energy production is much higher than the IEA's projection, which will
   result in an increased demand for water resources. However, if China
   were to apply broad policies to reduce CO2 emissions, the amount of
   water withdrawal would also decline compared with current energy
   strategy. Thus, reforming China's energy structure and reducing energy
   usage are not only urgent because of climate challenges and air

Abstract = {{LM3 is a new model of terrestrial water, energy, and carbon, intended
   for use in global hydrologic analyses and as a component of earth-system
   and physical-climate models. It is designed to improve upon the
   performance and to extend the scope of the predecessor Land Dynamics
   (LaD) and LM3V models by better quantifying the physical controls of
   climate and biogeochemistry and by relating more directly to components
   of the global water system that touch human concerns. LM3 includes
   multilayer representations of temperature, liquid water content, and ice
   content of both snowpack and macroporous soil bedrock; topography-based
   description of saturated area and groundwater discharge; and transport
   of runoff to the ocean via a global river and lake network. Sensible
   heat transport by water mass is accounted throughout for a complete
   energy balance. Carbon and vegetation dynamics and biophysics are
   represented as in LM3V. In numerical experiments, LM3 avoids some of the
   limitations of the LaD model and provides qualitatively (though not
   always quantitatively) reasonable estimates, from a global perspective,
   of observed spatial and/or temporal variations of vegetation density,
   albedo, streamflow, water-table depth, permafrost, and lake levels.
   Amplitude and phase of annual cycle of total water storage are simulated
   well. Realism of modeled lake levels varies widely. The water table
   tends to be consistently too shallow in humid regions. Biophysical
   properties have an artificial stepwise spatial structure, and
   equilibrium vegetation is sensitive to initial conditions. Explicit
   resolution of thick (>100 m) unsaturated zones and permafrost is
   possible, but only at the cost of long (>> 300 yr) model spinup times.}},

Abstract = {{The default fractional vegetation cover and terrain height were replaced
   by the estimated fractional vegetation cover, which was calculated by
   the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of Earth Observing
   System Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (EOS-MODIS) and the
   Digital Elevation Model of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)
   system. The near-surface meteorological elements over northeastern China
   were assimilated into the three-dimensional variational data
   assimilation system (3DVar) module in the Weather Research and
   Forecasting (WRF) model. The structure and daily variations of air
   temperature, humidity, wind and energy fields over northeastern China
   were simulated using the WRF model. Four groups of numerical experiments
   were performed, and the simulation results were analyzed of latent heat
   flux, sensible heat flux, and their relationships with changes in the
   surface energy flux due to soil moisture and precipitation over
   different surfaces. The simulations were compared with observations of
   the stations Tongyu, Naiman, Jinzhou, and Miyun from June to August,
   2009. The results showed that the WRF model achieves high-quality
   simulations of the diurnal characteristics of the surface layer
   temperature, wind direction, net radiation, sensible heat flux, and
   latent heat flux over semiarid northeastern China in the summer. The
   simulated near-surface temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed
   were improved in the data assimilation case (Case 2) compared with
   control case (Case 1). The simulated sensible heat fluxes and surface
   heat fluxes were improved by the land surface parameterization case
   (Case 3) and the combined case (Case 4). The simulated temporal
   variations in soil moisture over the northeastern arid areas agree well
   with observations in Case 4, but the simulated precipitation should be
   improved in the WRF model. This study could improve the land surface
   parameters by utilizing remote sensing data and could further improve
   atmospheric elements with a data assimilation system. This work provides
   an effective attempt at combining multi-source data with different
   spatial and temporal scales into numerical simulations. The assimilation
   datasets generated by this work can be applied to research on climate
   change and environmental monitoring of arid lands, as well as research
   on the formation and stability of climate over semiarid areas.}},

Abstract = {{The major present hindrance in using desalination to help alleviate
   global water scarcity is the cost of this technology, which, in turn is
   due to energy cost involved. This study examines historical trends in
   desalination and breaks up the cost of desalination into energy based
   and nonenergy based. It then develops the learning curves (relationship
   between cumulative production and market price) for desalination.
   Assuming that the photovoltaic (PV) technology will be the dominant form
   of energy used in the desalination process, the existing PV learning
   curve and desalination learning curve are combined to explore the
   viability of large-scale adoption of desalination in the future. The
   world has been divided into seven regions and it is assumed that water
   demand from desalinated water will be met only within the 100-km coastal
   belt. It is shown that, in most of the regions, other than sub-Saharan
   Africa, Central America, and South Asia (where water tariffs are low),
   the desalination (without considering energy) becomes viable by 2040.
   For PV technology, less than 1 million MW per annum growth is required
   till 2050 to make it affordable. Globally, desalination with renewable
   energy can become a viable option to replace domestic and industrial
   water demand in the 100-km coastal belt by 2050.}},

   hydroelectric reservoir (Danjiangkou Reservoir), China}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{401-414}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Hydroelectric reservoirs have been increasingly concerned with respect
   to their contributions to GHG emissions which are poorly understood due
   to data paucity particularly in monsoon region. This study presents the
   spatiotemporal changes of the carbonate system and CO2 flux of a
   hydroelectric reservoir (Dangjiankou Reservoir) in the subtropical
   monsoon climate region. A total of 21 field surveys conducted during
   2004-2011 revealed significant spatial and monthly variations of aqueous
   partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in the Reservoir. pCO(2) showed higher
   concentrations in the wet and warm seasons with an average of 595 +/-
   545 mu atm (ranging from 53 to 3751 vatm). Substantially higher pCO(2)
   (1132 +/- 1220 mu atm) was observed in the river below the dam.
   Pronounced seasonality of pCO(2) was controlled by seasonal monsoon
   rainfall, while photosynthetic CO2 uptake dominated spatial patterns and
   dry-month variability of pCO(2). Correlative analyses demonstrated that
   pCO(2) had strong positive correlations with Si and P speciations, TOC
   and DOC, negative correlations with DO saturation, TN and Chl-a. The
   estimated CO2 flux of 9 mmol m(-2)d(-1) from the Reservoir surface was
   relatively low, and river downstream the dam had a higher flux of 11(9)
   mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1), implying that water release from a reservoir would
   be an important channel for atmospheric CO2 sources. The annual CO2
   emission from the Danjiangkou Reservoir was estimated at 3.4 x 10(9) mol
   C y(-1). Information in the spatial and temporal variabilities in CO2
   flux from China's hydroelectric reservoirs is urgently needed for
   revision of global models of reservoirs' carbon emissions. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{An investigation of the engineering geological properties and
   geotechnical parameters of rock masses along a horseshoe-shaped head
   race tunnel (HRT) in the Teesta Stage-III hydroelectric project, Sikkim,
   India, was carried out to analyze the rock mass properties for optimum

   modeling were employed to determine rock mass properties. Several
   empirical equations and statistical analysis were performed to obtain
   the rational and reasonable results. The tunnel passes through different
   geological formations and critical zones. The field investigations
   indicate the presence of five joint sets, which contribute towards the
   development of unforeseen wedges along the tunnel alignment The
   attitudes of joints were measured by Brunton compass and analyzed with
   Dips v.5.1 software. The potential wedge block analysis and factor of
   safety (FS) were determined using Unwedge v3.0 software. The rock mass
   classification, assessment of tunnel stability and necessary support
   types were carried out with Q RMR and RMi systems as empirical tunnel
   support design methods. The numerical method (Phase(2) v.6.0) was used
   to quantify plastic zone and squeezing potential of the tunnel. The
   installed support systems as per empirical methods were cross-checked by
   means of numerical modeling, field observations and engineering
   judgments. According to the results from different methods, 3.0-4.4 m
   rock bolts, shotcrete 0.1-0.15 m, wire mesh and final concrete lining
   were proposed. It was observed that the plastic and deformed zones
   surrounding the excavation area got appreciably reduced after the

Abstract = {{Severe stress release has occurred to the surrounding rocks of the
   typically columnar jointed basalt after excavation at the Baihetan
   Hydropower Station, Jinsha River, China, where cracking, collapse, and
   other types of failure may take place occasionally due to relaxation
   fracture. In order to understand the relaxation fracture characteristics
   of the columnar jointed basalt in the entire excavation process at the
   diversion tunnel of the Baihetan Hydropower Station, real-time
   microseismic monitoring tests were performed. First, the applicability
   of a geophone and accelerometer was analyzed in the columnar jointed
   basalt tunnel, and the results show that the accelerometer was more
   applicable to the cracking monitoring of the columnar jointed basalt.
   Next, the waveform characteristics of the microseismic signals were
   analyzed, and the microseismic signals were identified as follows: rock
   fracture signal, drilling signal, electrical signal, heavy vehicle
   passing signal, and blast signal. Then, the attenuation characteristics
   of the microseismic signals in the columnar jointed basalt tunnel were
   studied, as well as the types and characteristics of the columnar
   jointed basalt fracture. Finally, location analysis was conducted on the
   strong rock fracture events, in which four or more sensors were
   triggered, to obtain the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics
   and laws of the columnar jointed basalt relaxation fracture after
   excavation. The test results are not only of important reference value

Abstract = {{In this paper, two-step hierarchical methodology is utilized to quantify
   the transportation related carbon, energy and water footprint (FP) of
   nation's manufacturing sectors and evaluate the environmental vs.
   economic performance based on eco-efficiency scores. The methodology
   consists of an integrated application of the economic input output life
   cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)
   approaches. In the first phase, EIO-LCA is employed to quantify the
   environmental impacts associated with the activities between 276
   manufacturing sectors and the transportation industry and the second
   phase compares the overall environmental impact vs. economic benefit
   tradeoff by determining the eco-efficiency value of each sector. Results
   of EIO-LCA indicated that food manufacturing is found to be as the major
   driver of carbon, energy and water FP categories with an approximate
   share of 22\% of the total impact on freight transportation activities
   in the transportation industry. Additionally, based on DEA-based
   sustainability performance assessment results, vast majority of U.S.
   manufacturing sectors were found to be inefficient (eco-efficiency <1).
   Only tobacco manufacturing was found to be eco-efficient among 53 major
   manufacturing sectors and the U.S. average was obtained as 0.5. Results
   indicated that inefficient U.S. manufacturing sectors need to reach an
   average reduction of 50\% on the carbon, energy and water FP impacts to
   reach the 100\% eco-efficiency frontier. Additionally, the weight of the
   transported goods was incorporated into the economic output as \$/ton-km
   carriage, which yielded highly correlated results with the initial
   assessment based on total economic output only. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In complex coupled natural-human systems (CNH), multitype networks link
   social, environmental, and economic systems with flows of matter,
   energy, information, and value. Embedded Resource Accounting (ERA) is a
   systems analysis framework that includes the indirect connections of a
   multitype CNH network. ERA is conditioned on perceived system
   boundaries, which may vary according to the accountant's point of view.
   Both direct and indirect impacts are implicit whenever two subnetworks
   interact in such a system; the ratio of two subnetworks' impacts is the
   embedded intensity. For trade in the services of water, this is
   understood as the indirect component of a water footprint, and as
   virtual water trade. ERA is a generalization of input-output, footprint,
   and substance flow methods, and is a type of life cycle analysis. This
   paper presents results for the water and electrical energy system in the
   western U.S. This system is dominated by California, which outsources
   the majority of its water footprint of electrical energy. Electricity
   trade increases total water consumption for electricity production in
   the western U.S. by 15\% and shifts water use to water-stressed Colorado
   River Basin States. A systemic underaccounting for water footprints
   occurs because state-level processes discount a portion of the water
   footprint occurring outside of the state boundary.}},

Abstract = {{Inaugurated in 2006, the Irape Hydroelectric Plant has the highest dam

   of Brasilia is monitoring this structure since the beginning of its
   reservoir filling. The reservoir triggered seismicity caused by the

   important object of study for understanding this phenomenon. This paper
   aims at studying the seismicity recorded from January to May 2006, as
   well as to characterize the geology around the Hydroelectric Plant Irape
   in order to identify and describe the structures that help for better
   understanding the seismic events. The spatial orientation of the seismic
   events obtained by analyzing polarity and waveform is consistent with
   the guidance of prominent relief lineaments. These faults can be found
   attached to a larger structure with main NE/SW direction and tens of
   kilometers, which would be responsible for capturing Jequitinhonha and
   Aracuai rivers. This great lineament is interpreted herein as a
   structure related to a late stage of the Brasiliano-Panafrican event.
   The solution of focal mechanism, created using an inversion method of
   the waveform in the time domain, indicates that the direction of the
   possible plans are correlated to main failure of brittle structures

Abstract = {{Internationally, rainwater tank systems have experienced a renaissance
   in urban areas in recent times as they are perceived to be a low cost
   source substitution option for many end uses or micro-components (e.g.
   toilet, clothes washer, irrigation, etc.) of water demand. While there
   are many studies that have been conducted investigating rainwater tank
   performance, none have explored their water-energy nexus at a

   reveal the energy intensity of three rainwater tank end uses in 19
   residential homes located in Gold Coast City, Queensland, Australia.
   Half flush toilet cistern events were found to have the highest
   variability of energy intensity values between homes (1.05-3.32 Wh/L)

   events had a tighter range (1.02-2.30 Wh/L) and slightly lower energy

   intensity values were quite variable (0.90-2.73 Wh/L) but on average

Abstract = {{China has laid out an ambitious strategy for developing its vast shale
   gas reserves. This study developed an input-output based hybrid
   life-cycle inventory model to estimate the energy use, water
   consumption, and air emissions implications of shale gas infrastructure
   development in China over the period 2013-2020, including well drilling
   and operation, land rig and fracturing fleet manufacture, and pipeline
   construction. Multiple scenarios were analyzed based on different
   combinations of well development rates, well productivities, and success
   rates. Results suggest that 700-5100 petajoules (PJ) of primary energy
   will be required for shale gas infrastructure development, while the net
   primary energy yield of shale gas production over 2013-2020 was
   estimated at 1650-7150 PJ, suggesting a favorable energy balance.
   Associated emissions of CO(2)e were estimated at 80-580 million metric
   tons, and were primarily attributable to coal-fired electricity
   generation, fugitive methane, and flaring of methane during shale gas
   processing and transmission. Direct water consumption was estimated at
   20-720 million metric tons. The largest sources of energy use and
   emissions for infrastructure development were the metals, mining,

Abstract = {{A model that couples the rock matrix and fracture flow is employed to
   simulate the flow and solute transport in fractured porous media. The
   porous matrix is represented using an equivalent continuum model, and
   discrete fractures are described using a discrete-fracture network
   model. Data on the fracture properties were collected from the study
   area to randomly generate the fractures. The model was calibrated and
   validated using the measured groundwater levels and tracer test data.
   The results indicate that the groundwater levels and concentrations
   simulated using the coupled model agree well with the observed data. In
   contrast, those obtained using the continuum model for the entire domain
   do not. In the fracture areas in which abnormal groundwater levels were
   observed (i.e., where the level was lower than the Yalong River stage),
   the coupled model effectively captures and replicates the primary
   geological and hydrogeological characteristics. Once again, the
   continuum model results do not. A sensitivity analysis of the parameters
   showed that an order of magnitude variation in the hydraulic
   conductivity corresponds to a 0.05-0.13\% variation in groundwater
   levels, implying that changes in hydraulic conductivity have little
   effect on groundwater level. Additionally, a half order of magnitude
   increase or decrease in the dispersion parameters leads to a 0.6-4.26\%
   variation in concentration. Thus, the response of the concentration to
   changes in dispersion parameters is not significant. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{Pakistan is facing acute power dearth these days due to which people are
   suffering from privation and their economic condition is deflating.
   Expensive imported fossil fuel for thermal power generation is pressing
   them hard and exacerbating the situation. The total power produced in
   the country by all means is less by 4000 MW than the requirement of
   Pakistan. So this is the prime time to think about exploring aboriginal
   and renewable power resources. This article converses about hydro power
   resources of Swat, North Pakistan, one of the most promising areas in
   hydro power production. The area drained by the Swat River and its
   tributary net work is a part of Kohistan Himalayas and has a potential
   of more than 1000 MW that can contribute 25\% to the total energy
   shortfall in the country and the same is 150\% more than the shortfall
   experienced in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that hosts Swat
   Valley. Due to great relief difference acquired within a small stretch,
   the perennial Swat River and its tributaries become pertinent for power

Abstract = {{Energy and water have become major factors limiting sustainable
   development in China. Energy efficiency and optimization of water
   management are critical for the healthy growth of the Chinese economy,
   Current national energy policies fail to adequately address water use
   issues. Similarly, current water policies do not consider the impact of
   energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, few
   studies have investigated the relationship between energy consumption
   and water use. The present study analyzes the energy-water nexus in
   Chinese industries using input-output tables. Coefficients that
   characterize the relationship between energy consumption and water are
   used to describe the supply-consumption relationship between the water
   supply and primary energy sectors. Next, we calculate the water-saving
   effects associated with the enforcement of energy-saving policies in
   selected industrial sectors during the eleventh Five-year Plan, from
   2005 to 2010. These calculations address the ferrous metals, non-ferrous
   metals, petrochemical engineering, building materials, and electricity
   industries as well as key light industries. Our findings indicate that
   energy-saving efforts in these industries will result in savings in
   water consumption. This study suggests that a cooperative relationship
   between water and energy conservation efforts should be an important
   factor in creating policies that encourage simultaneous savings of both
   resources. Additionally, the study indicates that government should
   promote water- and energy-saving techniques in key industrial sectors to
   encourage cooperative water and energy conservation. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{43-55}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Due to government subsidies, Brazil has witnessed an increase in the
   installation and use of small solar water heating systems in low-income
   housing projects. Although the initiative has reduced the load curve
   during peak times due to the reduced use of electric showerheads,
   measurement and verification (M\&V) are needed to validate the savings.
   M\&V procedures should take into account the social and economic
   variability of low-income housing developments. To improve M\&V in
   low-income housing projects, this paper presents a methodology for
   identifying homogeneous subgroups based on their energy-saving
   potential. This research strategy involved a cluster analysis designed
   to improve the understanding of what energy savers and other influencing
   factors exist. A case study in Londrina Brazil was undertaken with 200
   low-income families. Five clusters, created based on savings potential,
   were defined. The results showed that only two clusters demonstrated
   good electricity savings, representing 47\% of families. However, two
   clusters, or 37\%, did not provide satisfactory savings, and the other
   16\% did not provide any consumption history due to previous use of
   illegal city electricity connection practices. Therefore, studies
   confirm the need for a detailed measurement of the representative
   subgroups to assess the influence of human behaviour on potential
   SWHS-induced savings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In Brazil, over the next two decades, an additional 31.7 GW will be
   added to the hydropower sector in the northern region, to keep pace with
   the country's growing economy. Due to the socio-environmental
   vulnerability of this region, there is international concern about its
   conservation. Since 2007, the hydroelectric potential inventory has
   employed Integrated Environmental Assessments (IEA), taking into
   consideration an analysis of the cumulative and synergistic impacts of
   all the hydropower plants in the river basin. Also available is the
   Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), a tool that has been used by
   the National Water Agency in its Strategic Water Resources Plan, which
   aims to support decision making at the political, planning, and program
   levels in the river basin, employing sustainable development scenarios.
   Both tools have been recently used in Brazil, and this paper aims to
   analyze their differences and their main contributions to the
   decision-making process in the Brazilian power sector. Therefore, we
   analyzed 3 studies on the implementation of new hydropower plants in the
   Tocantins-Araguaia River Basins: the Strategic Water Resources Plan for
   Tocantins and Araguaia River Basins-PERH-TA (using the SEA methodology),
   the LEA of the Tocantins River Basin and the IEA of the Araguaia River
   Basin, analyzing their methodologies, scenarios, results and
   recommendations. We found that the SEA, in contrast to the LEA, provides
   a broader and more independent vision about the social and environmental
   impacts. After the conclusion of the integrated and strategic studies,
   we verified that some recommendations are not being followed in the HPP
   planning process, since some dams had problems with environmental
   licenses, as mentioned in the studies. Therefore, we conclude that
   methodological adjustments, as well as political and institutional
   enhancements in these processes could make the tools more useful. (C)

Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{284-289}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Energy consumption in developed as well as developing countries is high,
   especially in the residential and commercial building sectors.
   Researchers have been working on several technologies for the reduction
   of energy consumption in buildings; among them, energy-harvesting
   techniques are quite promising. In this paper, we explore a possibility
   of harnessing energy from grey water, while it flows down through
   high-raised buildings. We propose the usage of a micro/pico hydro
   turbine installed at the ground floor of a high rise building that
   utilizes the energy of grey water falling from floors above, to generate
   electricity. The electrical energy generated from the turbine can be
   utilized further in numerous ways. Scaled prototype of the same has been
   developed and tested. The proposed design of a gravity-energized
   wastewater system in high-rise buildings for generation of
   hydroelectricity is being checked for its feasibility in Indian markets.
   Calculation shows that the proposed system is commercially promising for
   most of the major cities in India. We also discuss cost benefits

   commercialization of this technology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Pulses play a major role in providing overall prosperity to the small

   system as a crop rotation improves soil fertility and crop productivity
   of cereals and oil seeds. Chickpea is one of the important pulses
   cultivated in Vertisols during winter season. We examined chickpea
   cultivars for energy use efficiency, economics, physiological efficiency
   and water use efficiency (WUE) under different rainfall situations for
   their sustainable yield and overall profit, in Vertisols of semi-arid
   tropics of South India. Results revealed that low input energy and high
   grain and stover yields of cultivars result in higher total output
   energy and net benefit energy. Higher dry matter efficiency of 0.702 was
   observed with medium-duration cultivar, whereas WUE was higher in
   short-duration cultivar followed by medium-duration cultivar. We
   conclude that medium-duration cultivar and short-duration cultivar are
   more suitable for the SAT region in terms of greater energy benefits,
   higher income per unit area, physiological efficiency and water use
   efficiency. Thus short-duration cultivar could be cultivated during
   normal to above normal rainfall years and during normal to drought years

Abstract = {{Stricter emissions requirements on coal-fired power plants together with
   low natural gas prices have contributed to a recent decline in the use
   of coal for electricity generation in the United States. Faced with a
   shrinking domestic market, many coal companies are taking advantage of a
   growing coal export market. As a result, U.S. coal exports hit an
   all-time high in 2012, fueled largely by demand in Asia. This paper
   presents a comparative life cycle assessment of two scenarios: a
   baseline scenario in which coal continues to be burned domestically for
   power generation, and an export scenario in which coal is exported to
   Asia. For the coal export scenario we focus on the Morrow Pacific export
   project being planned in Oregon by Ambre Energy that would ship 8.8
   million tons of Powder River Basin (PRB) coal annually to Asian markets
   via rail, river barge, and ocean vessel. Air emissions (SOx, NOx, PM10,
   and CO(2)e) results assuming that the exported coal is burned for
   electricity generation in South Korea are compared to those of a
   business as usual case in which Oregon and Washington's coal plants,
   Boardman and Centralia, are retrofitted to comply with EPA emissions
   standards and continue their coal consumption. Findings show that
   although the environmental impacts of shipping PRB coal to Asia are
   significant, the combination of superior energy efficiency among newer
   South Korean coal-fired power plants and lower emissions from U.S.
   replacement of coal with natural gas could lead to a greenhouse gas
   reduction of 21\% in the case that imported PRB coal replaces other coal
   sources in this Asian country. If instead PRB coal were to replace
   natural gas or nuclear generation in South Korea, greenhouse gas
   emissions per unit of electricity generated would increase. Results are
   similar for other air emissions such as SOx, NOx and PM. This study
   provides a framework for comparing energy export scenarios and
   highlights the importance of complete life cycle assessment in
   determining net emissions effects resulting from energy export projects
   and related policy decisions.}},

Abstract = {{300 MW Baspa Ills India's largest private hydroelectric facility,
   located at the Baspa River which is an important left-hand tributary to
   the Sutlej River in the NW Himalaya (India). In this valley the Sangla
   palaeo-lake has been dammed around 8200 yr BP behind a rock-avalanche
   dam and Baspa II is located exactly on top of this palaeo-lake. This
   special location represents a very rare possibility to evaluate the
   short-term, river load and hydrological parameters measured during the
   planning and operational stages of Baspa II with the long-term
   parameters gained from the palaeo-lake sediments from the catchment.
   Sedimentological and geomorphological investigations of the lacustrine
   sediments have been used to reconstruct environmental changes during
   >2500 years of its existence. The Mid-Holocene erosion rates of the
   Baspa catchment estimated from the volume and duration of deposition of
   the exposed lake sediments are at 0.7-1.0 mm yr(-1), almost identical
   with the modern erosion rates calculated from river gauge data from
   Baspa II. Several charcoal layers and charcoal pieces from the uppermost
   palaeo-lake levels around 5000 cal yr BP might be related to woodland
   clearance and they possibly represent one of the oldest evidences for

Abstract = {{Surface energy partitioning and the characteristics of the water and
   energy cycle provide important information for improving land surface
   and weather forecast modelling. In this study, the land-atmospheric
   water and energy cycle of winter wheat was investigated on Loess Plateau
   in the northwest of China, using the eddy covariance technique, soil
   heat flux, and four component radiation measurements during the period
   from 8 April 2006 to 15 July 2006. Results show that the four components
   underwent daily changes throughout the period, and varied diurnally
   according to the synoptic conditions. Latent heat flux was the main
   consumer of available energy during the studied period. The daily energy
   partitionings LE/Rn, Hs/Rn and G0/Rn were on average 45\%, 34\% and
   10\%, respectively, and the Bowen ratio is estimated at 0.90. Surface
   albedo of winter wheat field was on average 0.19, over the total period
   from 8 April to 15 July, but decreased at the time of the heading of the
   wheat as compared to other seasons because of increased vegetation
   cover. The energy closure results show that the energy balance closure
   reached 89\% through a thermal storage term of soil correction, which
   indicates that an energy imbalance of 11\% was encountered in our
   observations. The daily variations in the water and energy fluxes were
   also analysed, including the diurnal variations on cloudy and clear sky
   days. Results show that the available sensible as well as latent heat
   flux both changed daily. The latent heat flux was primarily controlled

Abstract = {{In view of the potential problems in the system such as sustained
   oscillation and low damping ratio, which are not considered in
   traditional small-signal stability region (SSSR), an improved SSSR
   (ISSSR) calculation method based on the guardian map is proposed. First,
   according to the map theory, the system is mapped from the ISSSR to the
   negative half-plane. Then by direct sum operation the guardian map is
   constituted. Finally, the guardian map approach, which is able to solve
   the exact stability region of the Hurwitz matrix, is used for fast and
   accurate calculation of the boundary of ISSSR. Simulation tests on the
   IEEE 4-machine 11-node system and 16-machine 68-node system verify the
   correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method. Besides, the
   influence of the generator excitation system parameters on the ISSSR is
   also analysed, which is highly valuable in system dispatching
   instruction and small disturbance instability prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous cold regions water flow and energy transport models have
   emerged in recent years. Dissimilarities often exist in their
   mathematical formulations and/or numerical solution techniques, but few
   analytical solutions exist for benchmarking flow and energy transport
   models that include pore water phase change. This paper presents a
   detailed derivation of the Lunardini solution, an approximate analytical
   solution for predicting soil thawing subject to conduction, advection,
   and phase change. Fifteen thawing scenarios are examined by considering
   differences in porosity, surface temperature, Darcy velocity, and
   initial temperature. The accuracy of the Lunardini solution is shown to
   be proportional to the Stefan number. The analytical solution results
   obtained for soil thawing scenarios with water flow and advection are
   compared to those obtained from the finite element model SUTRA. Three
   problems, two involving the Lunardini solution and one involving the
   classic Neumann solution, are recommended as standard benchmarks for
   future model development and testing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Back to Africa: monitoring post-hydropower restoration to facilitate
   reintroduction of an extinct-in-the-wild amphibian}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring of the ecological efficiency of different restoration and
   mitigation measures is important to inform decision-making but can be
   challenging, especially in remote and low-resource settings. Species
   composition of the vegetation is sensitive to environmental variation,
   and can thus be used in restoration assessment, but this requires
   statistical approaches that can accommodate multivariate responses. We
   use principal response curves (PRC) to assess the efficiency of
   post-hydropower mitigation measures installed to secure the
   reintroduction of an extinct-in-the-wild amphibian back into its only
   native habitat.
   The endemic ovoviviparous Kihansi spray toad Nectophrynoides asperginis
   is only known from a wetland in the Lower Kihansi River Gorge in the
   Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania. River flow was diverted from the
   gorge for hydropower production in 1999, causing the spray wetland to
   desiccate, consequently threatening the toad and other plant and animal
   species dependent on the spray-zone habitat. To mitigate the toad
   population collapse, a sprinkler system was installed over a limited
   section of the original spray-zone wetlands to mimic the waterfall spray
   and toads were taken to the USA for ex situ breeding. The decline,
   extinction, ex situ breeding, and planned reintroduction of the species
   has driven substantial research on Kihansi spray toad biology. In
   contrast, the efficiency of the mitigation measures in restoring the
   spray-zone wetland habitat required for its successful reintroduction
   has not been formally evaluated.
   Here, we analyze re-sampled vegetation data from the spray-zone wetland
   over a period of eight years by means of principal response curves to
   investigate if the post-hydropower mitigation measures have successfully
   restored the pre-hydropower ecosystem. The results show that the
   spray-zone vegetation is recovering. The wetland flora and especially
   species important to the Kihansi spray toad have increased and the
   restored ecosystem has stabilized, favoring the reintroduction of the
   Kihansi spray toad to its native habitat. However, the wetland ecosystem
   is not restored entirely and continued mitigation measures are needed.
   Continued monitoring is essential to support evidence-based restoration,
   and we conclude that assessment based on vegetation monitoring coupled
   with principal response curve analyses provides a cost-effective and
   efficient monitoring tool for such projects.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The vision of harnessing the Congo River's immense flow to generate
   power for the African continent has existed in the agenda of energy
   planners and politicians for nearly a century. However after the
   installations of Inga I in 1972 and Inga II in 1982, progress came to a
   standstill. Recently though the larger aspirations of Grand Inga seem to
   be moving forward again. Construction of Inga III low-head is set to
   commence in 2015 with a projected capacity of 4755 MW, of which 2500 MW
   are contracted for the South African market. Upon completion, the total
   capacity of Grand Inga could reach 42 GW. In this paper, we present
   scenario-driven results of a Sub-Saharan African-focused
   partial-equilibrium energy model related to the further development of
   the project. The analysis is presented to show the broad range of
   possible energy futures related to this project, without taking into
   deep consideration the admittedly important issues related to
   governance, environmental impacts or social tensions. Scenarios are
   developed to assess the energy outlook of the Central African power
   pool, in which Grand Inga is located, and the exchange of electricity
   between regions when the project is completed. The project has the
   potential to cover the increasing needs for power in this power pool and
   provide electricity exports to other regions; primarily Southern and
   Western Africa in a high demand scenario and Southern and Northern
   Africa in a low demand scenario. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Rice is the major staple food crop in the North Eastern Region of India
   (26.2 million hectare geographical area) and the region has a deficit of
   1.40 million tones of rice, mainly due to low productivity (1.72 t
   ha(-1)). Field experiments were conducted for the first time to evaluate
   the new techniques of rice cultivation, viz. the system of rice
   intensification (SRI) and integrated crop management (ICM) along with
   conventional rice culture (CRC) for improving productivity, water and
   energy use efficiency during the rainy seasons of 2004-07 at the ICAR
   Research Complex for North Eastern Hill Region, Umiam, Meghalaya (950 m
   msl), India. Three stand establishment methods, viz. SRI, ICM and CRC in
   main plots, and five nutrient management practices, viz. recommended
   dose of fertilizers (RDF = 80:26:33 kg NPK ha(-1)), farmyard manure
   (FYM) 10 t ha(-1), RDF + FYM 5 t ha(-1), 50\% RDF + FYM 10 t ha(-1), and
   a control (no fertilizer and manure) in sub-plots, were tested in a
   split-plot design; only few meaningful interactions were found. Results
   showed a higher number of panicles per square metre under CRC and ICM
   compared with SRI. However, the number of panicles per hill, grains per
   panicle and the test weight remained higher in the SRI method. In terms
   of mean grain yield, ICM (4.86 t ha(-1)) and SRI (4.72 t ha) produced
   12.8 and 9.6\%, respectively, higher grain yield over CRC (4.3 t
   ha(-1)). Among the nutrient management practices, the application of RDF
   + FYM 5 t ha(-1) (5.0 t ha(-1)) and 50\% RDF + FYM 10 t ha(-1) (4.87 t
   ha(-1)) not only produced higher grain yield of rice (23.8 and 20.5\%,
   respectively, higher yield over control) but also maintained higher soil
   available N, P and organic carbon at harvest compared with other
   nutrient management practices. Photosynthesis rate and water use
   efficiency were found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher under SRI,
   whereas the transpiration rate was higher under CRC. The ICM method
   recorded maximum net return and energy output to input ratio, which was
   followed by SRI and CRC. Therefore, the ICM method of rice cultivation
   would be the preferred option for the sub-tropical mid-hills of eastern
   Indian Himalayas.}},

Volume = {{175}},

Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Columnar jointed basalts are characterized by a self-organized joint
   network of discontinuities and pose a difficult challenge for
   geotechnical engineering design due to their inherent anisotropic
   nature. We explore here the anisotropic characteristics of the columnar
   basalt formation in the Chinese Baihetan hydropower station, including
   aspects of the geometrical rock structure, deformation, and strength
   anisotropy. Site investigations reveal that a typical cross section of
   the columnar basalt blocks is mainly quadrangular and pentagonal with an
   average edge length of 0.152 m. Three types of joints with different
   macro- and micro-characteristics form the columnar jointed rock mass and
   are identified by scanning electron microscopy. In situ ultrasonic tests
   further confirm that the columnar basalt prisms exhibit transverse
   isotropy with the plane of isotropy perpendicular to the column axis, as
   can also be observed in the field. Strength anisotropy is confirmed by
   point load and uniaxial compression tests. The mechanical and
   anisotropic characteristics of Baihetan's jointed basalt mass can be
   explained by its multi-scale joints pattern by means of Goodman's
   stiffness equation. We find that the anisotropic coefficients obtained
   for its deformability and strength are similar for all testing methods
   employed, including in situ P wave velocity, point load tests, and
   uniaxial compression tests. This result confirms the strong anisotropic
   effect in these rock masses and facilitates, an issue that must be
   considered when assigning input parameters for various classification
   and numerical analyses schemes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   assessment of 46 registered hydro CDM projects under the Kyoto Protocol
   in terms of their potential impact on the envisaged social development

   organizations managing hydroelectric initiatives in Brazil can provide
   the pathway toward achieving a number of important social benefits.
   Successful projects were found to have good community involvement and
   were managed by both cooperative ventures and money-making corporations.
   The research also identified several challenges that are hindering hydro

Abstract = {{Associated with being green, clean and small-scale, small hydroelectric
   power (SHP) projects generally enjoy a positive image. In India SHP
   promises answers to issues such as meeting a growing electricity demand,
   facilitating lucrative investment opportunities, and climate change
   considerations. The features of being green, clean and small-scale have
   contributed to the assumption of SHP as an essentially uncontested
   technology.
   Empirical studies questioning this assumption are scarce. Research on
   SHP has so far remained rather hypothetical and policy-level-focused.
   This article investigates the social acceptability of small
   hydroelectric plants in India by empirically looking at how people
   engage with these plants. It thereby underlines the importance of
   studying technologies in their local context. Based on a detailed case
   study analysis of two SHP projects in Karnataka, India, the article
   shows how SHP projects are contested on the local level. The engagement
   of local people played a crucial role in the contestation of the plants
   and led to significant and unexpected outcomes and effects.
   The article highlights the importance of having a broader perspective in
   the development of SHP that goes beyond a mindset of technological
   fixes. This includes taking account of existing water infrastructure and
   a broader range of water users. The article shows that the
   implementation of SHP projects does not take place in a void. Rather,

Abstract = {{We used a land surface model constrained using data from flux tower
   sites, to analyze the biases in ecosystem energy and water fluxes
   arising due to the use of meteorological reanalysis datasets. Following
   site-level model calibration encompassing major vegetation types from
   the tropics to the northern high-latitudes, we repeated the site and
   global simulations using two reanalysis datasets: the NCEP/NCAR and the
   CRUNCEP. In comparison with the model simulations using observed
   meteorology from sites, the reanalysis-driven simulations produced
   several systematic biases in net radiation (R-n), latent heat (LE), and
   sensible heat (H) fluxes. These include: (i) persistently positive
   tropical/subtropical biases in R-n using the NCEP/NCAR, and gradually
   transitioning to negative R-n biases in the higher latitudes; (ii) large
   positive H biases in the tropics/subtropics using the NCEP/NCAR; (iii)
   negative LE biases using the NCEP/NCAR above 40 degrees N; (iv) high
   tropical LE using the CRUNCEP in comparison with observationally derived
   global estimates; and (v) flux-partitioning biases from canopy and
   ground components. Across vegetation types, we investigated the role of
   the meteorological drivers (shortwave and longwave radiation,
   atmospheric humidity, temperature, precipitation) and their seasonal
   biases in controlling these reanalysis-driven uncertainties. At the
   global scale, our site-level analysis explains several model-data
   differences in the LE and H fluxes when compared with observationally
   derived global estimates of these fluxes. Using our results, we discuss
   the implications of site-level model calibration on subsequent
   regional/global applications to study energy and hydrological processes.
   The flux-partitioning biases presented in this study have potential
   implications on the couplings among terrestrial carbon, energy, and
   water fluxes, and for the calibration of land-atmosphere
   parameterizations that are dependent on LE/H partitioning.}},

   feature impacting a river. Understanding the effects of river
   impoundment on the downstream environment is critical to decision-making
   for water resource protection. The changes caused by impoundment are
   changes in water quality and the resulting effect on the phytoplankton
   community structure. The impacts caused by a series of reservoirs along
   a river are still not well understood. In this study, we conducted an
   investigation of five reservoirs along the Maotiao River, China. We
   found that a series of impoundments plays a role in decreasing the
   phytoplankton biomass in downstream reservoirs. Within the studied area,
   nitrogen is not a limiting factor for phytoplankton growth. The ratio of
   silicon to phosphorus (Si:P) can become a major factor in the regulation
   of phytoplankton community structure. The Si:P ratio increased from
   upstream to downstream reservoirs, causing a concurrent increase in the
   percentage of Bacillariophyta, particularly during the winter. In
   addition, our results indicate that the creation of dams eliminates Si
   limitation downstream.}},

Abstract = {{Increased water demand and scarce freshwater resources have forced
   communities to seek nontraditional water sources. These challenges are
   exacerbated in coastal communities, where population growth rates and
   densities in the United States are the highest. To understand the
   current management dilemma between constrained surface and groundwater
   sources and potential new water sources, Tampa Bay, Florida (TB), and
   San Diego, California (SD), were studied through 2030 accounting for
   changes in population, water demand, and electricity grid mix. These
   locations were chosen on the basis of their similar populations, land
   areas, economies, and water consumption characters as well as their
   coastal locations and rising contradictions between water demand and
   supply. Three scenarios were evaluated for each study area: (1)
   maximization of traditional supplies; (2) maximization of seawater
   desalination; and (3) maximization of nonpotable water reclamation.
   Three types of impacts were assessed: embodied energy, greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emission, and energy cost. SD was found to have higher embodied
   energy and energy cost but lower GHG emission than TB in most of its
   water infrastructure systems because of the differences between the
   electricity grid mixes and water resources of the two regions.
   Maximizing water reclamation was found to be better than increasing
   either traditional supplies or seawater desalination in both regions in
   terms of the three impact categories. The results further imply the
   importance of assessing the energy-water nexus when pursuing demand-side
   control targets or goals as well to ensure that the potentially most
   economical options are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Water systems in snowmelt-dominated hydroregions such as California's
   Sierra Nevada mountains are sensitive to regional climate change,
   hydropower systems in particular. In this study, a water resources
   management model was developed for the upper west slope Sierra Nevada to
   understand the potential effects of regional climate warming on
   hydropower at the watershed scale, a scale that has been largely
   neglected but is important for hydroregional planning. The model is
   developed with the Water Evaluation and Planning system (WEAP) and
   includes most water management infrastructure in the study region.
   Hydropower is simulated assuming historical long-term electricity demand
   and a spill minimization rule. The method is suitable for simulating
   generation for most of the main watersheds in the region. To assess the
   potential effect of climate warming, uniform air temperature increases
   of 0 degrees C, 2 degrees C, 4 degrees C, and 6 degrees C were
   considered, with no change in precipitation, to approximate regional
   warming through 2100. The highly productive northern Sierra Nevada sees
   large reductions in hydropower generation with decreases in annual
   runoff. The central watersheds see less reduction in annual runoff and
   can adapt better to changes in runoff timing. Generation in southern
   watersheds, which are less productive, decreases. Results from this
   study can help identify which watersheds might easily adapt to climate
   change, where hydropower is likely to conflict with other uses, and
   where more detailed operational studies are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Supersaturation and excess emission of greenhouse gases in freshwater
   reservoirs have received a great deal of attention in recent years.
   Although impoundment of reservoirs has been shown to contribute to the
   net emission of greenhouse gases, reservoir age, geographical
   distribution, submerged soil type and artificial regulation also have a
   great impact on their emissions. To examine how large scale reservoir
   operation impact the water column CO2 and its air-water interface flux,
   a field study was conducted in 2010 to evaluate potential ecological
   processes that regulate the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in the
   water column in the Pengxi River backwater area (PBA), a typical
   tributary in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. Measurements of total
   alkalinity (TA), pH and water temperature were applied to compute the
   pCO(2). And this approach was also validated by calculation of pCO(2)
   from the dissolved inorganic carbon data of samples. Partial least
   squares (PLS) regression was used to determine how the dynamics of the
   water pCO(2) were related to the available variables. The estimated
   pCO(2) in our sample ranged from 26 to 4,087 mu atm in the surface
   water. During low water operation from July to early September, there
   was an obvious pCO(2) stratification, and pCO(2) in the surface was
   almost unsaturated. This phenomenon was also observed in the spring
   bloom during discharge period. Conversely, there was no significant
   pCO(2) stratification and the entire water column was supersaturated
   during high water operation from November to the following February.
   Significant correlation was observed between the magnitude of pCO(2),
   DOand chlorophyll a, suggesting that phytoplankton dynamics regulate
   pCO(2) in the PBA. The average areal rate of CO2 emissions from the
   Pengxi River ranged from 18.06 to 48.09 mmol m(-2) day(-1), with an
   estimated gross CO2 emission from the water surface of 14-37 t day(-1)
   in this area in 2010. Photosynthesis and respiration rates by
   phytoplankton might be the dominant processes that regulated pCO(2) in
   the water column. We conclude that pCO(2) values in the surface water of
   Pengxi River could be regarded as potential sources of CO2 to the
   atmosphere were smaller or similar to those that have been reported for
   many other reservoirs to date.}},

Abstract = {{With limited land resources, inadequate energy supply, and growing water
   stress, South Asia faces the challenge of providing enough water and
   energy to grow enough food for the burgeoning population. Using
   secondary data from diverse sources, this paper explores the food,
   water, and energy nexus from a regional dimension, emphasizing the role
   of Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) ecosystem services in sustaining food,
   water, and energy security downstream. The analysis reveals that the
   issues and challenges in the food, water, and energy sectors are
   interwoven in many complex ways and cannot be managed effectively
   without cross-sectoral integration. The most distinctive feature of the
   nexus in South Asia is the high degree of dependency of downstream
   communities on upstream ecosystem services for dry-season water for
   irrigation and hydropower, drinking water, and soil fertility and
   nutrients. This finding suggests that along with cross-sectoral
   integration to improve the resource-use efficiency and productivity of
   the three sectors, regional integration between upstream and downstream
   areas is critical in food, water, and energy security. Within the nexus
   approach in South Asia, equal attention should be paid to management of
   HKH ecosystems-especially the watersheds, catchments, and headwaters of
   river systems and to tapping the potential of collaborative gains in
   water, hydropower, and other ecosystem services through coordination
   across HKH countries. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In recent decades, there has been a rapid rate of development of
   hydropower in China. The unprecedented rate of expansion, development
   scale, and large numbers of hydropower plants have posed a challenge to
   the operation of large-scale cascaded hydropower systems (OLCHSs), which
   has become one of the most important factors in ensuring the security
   and economic operation of the power grid in China. In this paper, a
   long-term optimal operation model is developed for the purpose of
   maximizing the total generated energy of cascaded hydropower plants. To
   solve the OLCHS problem effectively, an elite-guide particle swarm
   optimization (EGPSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper. An external
   archive set, which can preserve elite solutions during the evolution
   process, is employed to provide flying directions for particles. Since
   the OLCHS problem is a high-dimensional, nonlinear, multistage, and
   stringent constraint optimal problem, the proposed algorithm introduces
   three new innovations: a layer-partition approach is presented to divide
   the decision vectors into small ones according to the reservoir's
   relative position and hydraulic connection. Meanwhile, the initial
   solutions are generated in the proposed contractively feasible region so
   that operation results do not rely so much on the initial solution. To
   deal with the multiconstraint coupling problem, a constraint-corridor
   method is adapted to handle these complex constraints in the cascaded
   hydropower system. Finally, this novel strategy is applied successfully
   to solve the optimal operation of a large-scaled cascaded hydropower
   system in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Compared with the
   conventional method, the proposed EGPSO has a competitive performance in
   not only simulation results but also computing time, which offers a new
   approach to solving high-dimensional and complicated problems of
   optimizing reservoir dispatching.}},

Abstract = {{The Santo Antonio and Jirau dams, under construction on the Madeira

   part of a planned series of waterways that, if completed, would open

   deforestation. The dams have significant social impacts, including
   displacing riverside population and eliminating livelihoods from

Abstract = {{Sustainable production of second-generation energy crops on marginal

   hectares particularly abundant in semiarid marginal land. The simulation
   of 20-year soil water content in bare soil, the winter wheat field, and
   the Miscanthus field across the Loess Plateau suggested that the
   long-term production of Miscanthus would not cause water depletion in
   deep soil. This finding addressed a serious concern that growing
   high-biomass plants in the Loess Plateau might lead to deep-soil water
   depletion, which was suggested to be the cause of previous failure of
   afforestation. Planting Miscanthus was effective in reducing surface
   runoff and consequently preventing water and soil loss in this heavily

   However, environmentally sensible designs do not automatically imply a
   promising future. The case-study SHP is on the verge of bankruptcy due
   to financial losses, which can be attributed to the current
   grid-connected cost of electricity of 0.23 CNY/kWh. The emergy exchange
   ratio (EER) quantitatively demonstrates that the fair price of
   electricity from the perspective of emergy balance is 0.4 CNY/kWh. The
   sensitivity analysis reveals that the inherent defect of unstable
   operation, which is exhibited by the SHP system, greatly affects the
   environmental performance of a SHP plant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study aims for the characterization of the geological setting of
   300 MW Baspa II, India's largest private hydroelectric facility which
   was built on top of a relict rock avalanche dammed palaeo-lake (Baspa
   Valley, NW Himalaya). Geologically, the hydroelectric installation is
   located in the Higher Himalayan Crystalline, just above the active
   Karcham Normal Fault, which is reactivating the Early Miocene Main
   Central Thrust, one of the principal Himalayan faults. The area is
   seismically active and mass-movements are common. At ca. 8200 yr BP the
   Baspa River was blocked behind a 142 x 10(6) m(3) rock avalanche dam
   which created a ca. 260 m deep palaeo-lake. The whole palaeo-lake was
   completely filled with sediments in about 3100 years, making the Sangla
   palaeo-lake to a very rare example of a mass-movement dam with very long
   duration.
   The hydroelectric installation was built with its intake situated
   directly on top of the mass-movement dammed palaeo-lake of Sangla,
   utilizing the convex knick point in the river profile to increase the
   head for Baspa II for ca. 125 m, compared to the reconstructed
   longitudinal profile of the river prior to the mass-movement, which
   amounts for about 18\% of its design head.
   At least 5 levels of soft-sediment deformation have been recorded in the
   exposed part of the lacustrine sediments of Sangla palaeo-lake,
   including brecciated laminae, overturned laminae, folds, faults and
   deformation bands, separated by undeformed deposits. They are
   interpreted as seismites, indicating at least 5 earthquakes within 2495
   +/- 297 years strong enough to cause liquefaction. These observations
   extend the local seismicity record considerably into the past and
   indicate more and possibly stronger seismic events than might be
   expected from the instrumental measurements. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{An experimental methodology was developed to assess an on-line cleaning
   technique to mitigate biofouling in plate heat exchangers. The
   exchangers are used in the cooling system of the journal bearings of
   hydro-generators of a power plant. The cleaning technology tested
   consisted of a non-intrusive electronic device wrapped around the water
   cooling piping that generated an electric field to inhibit the growth of
   micro-organisms on the heat transfer surfaces. Limnology studies
   explained the phenomenon of biofouling formation caused by limnophilous
   microorganisms present in the deepest parts of the reservoir manage to
   survive in hostile environments under anoxic conditions. Two criteria
   were adopted to assess the performance of the antifouling technology: a
   hydrodynamic criterion based on Kakac's pressure drop equation for plate
   heat exchangers and a thermal criterion (index of fouling) that takes
   into account the heat transfer effectiveness under the clean and fouled
   conditions of operation. The position of the antifouling device produced
   better results when installed in the primary cooling circuit. For the
   conditions studied, the cleaning technique mitigated biofouling but did
   not eliminate it completely. Excitation of the flow by an electric field
   diminishes the pressure drop and the index of fouling when compared to
   the unexcited flow condition. Control and reduction of the fouling
   thermal resistance is highly desired as it drastically lessens
   mechanical pumping costs and increases heat transfer performance. (C)

Abstract = {{The Tonle Sap is the largest lake in Southeast Asia and its fishery
   supports the livelihood and nutrition of millions of people in Cambodia.
   However, the hydrological and ecological drivers of this ecosystem are
   changing as a result of hydropower development on the Mekong River and
   global climate change. The objective of this study was to quantify the
   impacts of the Mekong's future hydrological alterations on aquatic net
   primary production (NPP) of the Tonle Sap. A three-dimensional (3D)
   hydrodynamic model was used to evaluate eleven scenarios of hydropower
   development and climate change, with respect to water flows, suspended
   sediments, and floodplain habitat cover, which were identified as the
   key drivers of productivity change. We found that hydropower development
   would cause the most distinct changes in seasonality by reducing wet
   season water levels and increasing dry season water levels. Combined
   scenarios of hydropower and climate change revealed that areas of open
   water and rainfed/irrigated rice would expand by 35 +/- 3\% and 16 +/-
   5\%, respectively, while optimal area for gallery forest would decrease
   by 40 +/- 27\%. The estimated annual net sedimentation was projected to
   decrease by 56 +/- 3\% from the 3.28 +/- 0.93 million tons baseline
   values. Annual average NPP in the open water and in the floodplain was
   1.07 +/- 0.06 and 3.67 +/- 0.61 million tons C, respectively, and a
   reduction of 34 +/- 4\% is expected. Our study concludes that Tonle
   Sap's drivers of ecological productivity - habitat cover, sedimentation,
   and NPP - will face a significant change, and a decline of its
   ecosystem's services should be expected if mitigation and adaptation
   strategies are not implemented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The river downstream from a dam can be more contaminated by mercury than

   occurs downstream. We investigated the seasonal variation of
   methylmercury levels in the Balbina reservoir and how they correlated

   and fishes were collected upstream and at sites between 0.5 and 250 km
   downstream from the dam during four expeditions in 2011 and 2012.
   Variations in thermal stratification of the reservoir influenced the
   methylmercury levels in the reservoir and in the river downstream.
   Uniform depth distributions of methylmercury and oxygen encountered in
   the poorly stratified reservoir during the rainy season collections
   coincided with uniformly low methylmercury levels along the river
   downstream from the dam. During dry season collections, the reservoir
   was strongly stratified, and anoxic hypolimnion water with high
   methylmercury levels was exported downstream. Methylmercury levels
   declined gradually to 200 km downstream. In general, the methylmercury
   levels in plankton and fishes downstream from the dam were higher than
   those upstream. Higher methylmercury levels observed 200-250 km

Abstract = {{Multiscale streamflow forecasts are an essential information to support
   the definition of the optimal operational rules for each water reservoir
   in the Brazilian hydropower network. Currently, daily and weekly
   streamflow forecasts are mostly made by the auto-regressive (AR) class
   of statistical models and do not integrate any quantitative information
   from long term streamflow forecasts, although the multiscale operational
   policies (e.g. next day operation rule and long term risk aversion
   curves) are all connected. Here in this work we offer a new contribution
   to the realm of streamflow forecast models by exploring the concept of
   Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to connect monthly and daily streamflow
   forecasts in order to improve the performance of the last. Monthly
   streamflow forecasts are made here using a periodic auto-regressive
   exogenous model (PARX), which attempts to capture the persistence of the
   streamflow in the auto-regressive part and the runoff contribution in
   the exogenous portion through the use of climate information (e.g. an El
   Nino based index). Daily streamflow forecasts up to four weeks lead time
   are obtained from a simple auto-regressive model with seasonally varying
   coefficients. The multiscale connection is made through Bayesian model
   averaging of the monthly and daily forecasts, where the posterior
   probabilities of each model are estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   (MCMC) sampling, which accounts for uncertainties and allows the use of
   a wide variety of model distributions. The model performance is
   illustrated using 79 years of daily streamflow data from the Itaipu
   streamflow gauge, located in southern Brazil. The results show that
   beyond 17 days lead time the monthly forecast models present a higher
   skill to predict the daily flows. Combining both models through BMA
   leads to a synergy and an increase in the overall R-2 skill beyond 7
   days lead. The proposed approach is also flexible to support monthly
   streamflow forecasts from different (e.g. physical) models and is the
   first step in simulating monthly streamflow forecasts coupled with
   annual simulation of streamflows that considers low frequency
   variability and climate changes.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater emerged as a major source of irrigation in India during the
   mid-1970s. However, a large expansion in well irrigation due to a
   massive rural electrification programme, government policies of
   promoting private tube well construction and large subsidies on
   electricity for agricultural use resulted in groundwater
   over-abstraction in many semi-arid and arid regions of India. In
   addition, most of the direct and indirect measures to regulate
   groundwater use have met with little success and have been largely
   ineffective in arresting groundwater over-exploitation. This paper
   reviews the institutional and market-based instruments that are now
   being advocated by scholars and practitioners as potential instruments
   for sustainable groundwater use. The review mainly focuses on research
   that examined the viability and impacts of establishing private and
   tradable water rights in groundwater and pro rata pricing of electricity
   for irrigation use as instruments to arrest the problems of groundwater
   over-exploitation in India.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of hydropower facilities on existing low-head,

   including safety liability, fragmentation of river ecosystems, and
   persistent economic burden induced on state agencies due to regular
   inspection requirements. We conducted a feasibility study in the
   Piedmont region of North Carolina cataloguing over 1000 non-Federal dams
   with hydraulic head ranging from 4.6 m to 10.7 m (15 ft to 35 ft) and
   power capacity <300 kW ({''}micro{''} hydropower). Generation potential,
   greenhouse gas reductions, and financial viability were refined for 49
   low-head dams over a 30-year life cycle using industry standard software
   (RETScreen4). Results suggest that most of these dams are not
   financially viable for energy production under cost structures evaluated
   at the time of this study. However, our results indicate that some
   low-head dams may be viable for energy production if provided funding
   opportunities comparable to the concurrent wind and solar markets. (C)

Abstract = {{This study provides estimates for three sources related to power

   Estimates of avian mortality due to electrocution mortality for Canada
   (number of poles{*}birds/pole/year) ranged from 160,836 to 801,962 birds
   annually. Impacts are likely to be greater on raptors, owls, herons and
   cranes than on smaller, but more highly productive birds. Construction
   of transmission line likely impacted 2,588,494 nests and transmission
   line maintenance can possibly affect 388,274 nests each year. Avian
   mortality related to the construction and maintenance of transmission
   and distribution power lines is relatively small, and likely does not
   cause any significant impact at the population level. Operations of
   large water reservoirs created for hydro-power will rarely affect adults
   but result in the destruction of eggs in nidifigous species such as
   waterfowl and shorebirds or altricial species nestlings. An approximate
   estimate of avian mortality for Quebec due to hydro-power reservoirs
   gave us 152,162 nests/year, and does not cause a significant impact on a

Abstract = {{Although irrigation has markedly increased agricultural productivity in
   the North China Plain, it has reduced groundwater levels by up to 0.8 m
   yr(-1) and dried up the Yellow River for extended times since the 1970s.
   The objective of this study was to compare water, energy, and carbon
   fluxes in regions irrigated with groundwater and surface water (Yellow
   River) using almost four years of eddy covariance data from agricultural
   stations in Luancheng (water table depth: similar to 42 m) and Weishan
   (near Yellow River, water table depth: 1-3 m). Irrigation is mostly
   restricted to winter wheat as summer maize grows during the rainy
   season. Mean annual ET was 693 mm yr(-1) for Luancheng site, which is
   higher than Weishan site (648 mm, ignore partial years). About similar
   to 390-480 mm of ET occurred during the wheat season (from early October
   to next early June, about 247 days), 230-300 mm in the maize season
   (from early June to late September, about 107 days). Annual crop yields
   were similar to 6864 kg/ha in the two regions. Annual water use
   efficiencies ranged from 4 to 6 g CO2 kg(-1) H2O. Water use efficiencies
   were higher for maize than for wheat. Annual cropland carbon budget
   (CCB) was 230-280 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at the two sites and suggested a weak
   carbon sink. Irrigation compensated for seasonal and inter-annual
   variability in precipitation. Shifting the cropping pattern from
   wheat-maize double crops to a single crop of maize could significantly
   reduce water withdrawal and lead to a more sustainable use of water
   resource in this region. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   carbon price and liable (case three). A case study was considered for
   validation purposes. Steam turbine partial load equations and required
   pricing data under the various cases were derived. For this coal boiler

   indicate the introduction of the carbon price has made the installation
   of these types of systems more attractive in terms of economic benefits

   purchase the majority of its electricity demand from the grid in all
   three cases. Due to the low price of selling electricity, no excess

Abstract = {{AimWater-energy dynamics are often correlated with geographical patterns
   of terrestrial plant richness. However, the relative importance of water
   and energy on species richness is still being debated. Some studies
   suggest a transition in the relative importance of water and energy

   factor at low latitudes, whereas energy is the leading factor at high
   latitudes. The generality of this transition is yet to be established
   and is the focus of the current study. In particular, we examine whether
   differences in the evolutionary histories of two subgenera of Asian oaks
   influence the derived models of water-energy dynamics.
   LocationAsia (70-140 degrees E; 10-60 degrees N).
   MethodsWe performed geographically weighted regressions to quantify
   geographical variation in the relative importance of water and energy on
   the species richness of Asian oaks (Quercus L.). We also evaluated how
   evolutionary history influences the relative importance of water and
   energy in determining species richness, by comparing patterns in the two
   oak subgenera: Quercus subg. Quercus and Quercus subg. Cyclobalanopsis.
   In particular, we assessed how the ancestral climatic niche of these two
   subgenera (i.e. subgenus Quercus of temperate origin versus subgenus
   Cyclobalanopsis of tropical origin) relates to the relative importance
   of water and energy on contemporary diversity patterns.
   ResultsWe found no geographical transition line in the relative
   importance of water and energy along the latitudinal gradient studied.
   Instead, we found that the importance of energy relative to water on the
   species richness of subgenus Quercus increased from mid-latitudes (warm
   temperate regions) towards both tropical and boreal regions: this
   pattern might reflect that this subgenus originated in the temperate
   region. In contrast, the importance of both water and energy on the
   species richness of the tropical subgenus Cyclobalanopsis increased from
   tropical to boreal regions, probably due to a lack of adaptation to
   winter coldness.
   Main conclusionsOur results suggest that differences in the evolutionary
   history - specifically the ancestral climatic niche - of the two
   subgenera of oaks influence the effects of water-energy dynamics on
   species richness along a latitudinal gradient through niche
   conservatism.}},

Abstract = {{Brazil is the world's third largest producer of castor. The crop is
   mainly cultivated in the northeastern region of the country, but little
   information is available concerning the diurnal, seasonal and
   interannual variability of evapotranspiration (ET) and energy exchange
   of castor crops grown in the region, as well as the water use efficiency
   and yield. To address this gap in knowledge, the Bowen ratio method was
   used to measure energy balance and ET in 2004, 2005 and 2007. The
   experiments were performed in a 4-ha area at the Centro de Ciencias
   Agrarias, Federal University of Paraiba in Areia in the state of
   Paraiba, Brazil (6 degrees 58'S, 35 degrees 41'W, elevation 620 m). The
   study site had a micrometeorological tower with sensors for measuring
   air temperature and relative humidity located at two heights above
   castor canopy. Global and net radiation, rainfall, soil heat flux, and
   stored soil water at 0-1.0 m depth were also measured. Measurements from
   all of the sensors were recorded by a data logger every 60s and mean/sum
   data were logged every 1800s. Over 3 years, the net radiation (Rn)
   varied from 53.2 to 461.7W m(-2) and soil heat flux (G) varied from
   -10.5 to 58.9 W m(-2). Variation in energy partitioning into latent (LE)
   and sensible (H) heat fluxes was mainly associated with changes in
   stored soil water. H values were higher in 2004 and 2005 (35\% and 37\%
   of Rn, respectively) than in 2007 (25\% of Rn). Daily ET was very
   similar in 2004 and 2005 (2.29 and 2.34 mm day(-1), respectively) but
   increased to 3.42 mm day(-1) in 2007, mainly due to increased volume and
   more even rainfall distribution throughout the growing season. Total ET
   was 299.5, 334.3 and 656.6 mm in 2004, 2005 and 2007, respectively.
   Castor showed a low yield (60, 324 and 988.3 kg ha(-1) in 2004, 2005 and
   2007, respectively) and low water use efficiency (0.02, 0.10 and 0.15 kg
   m(-3) in 2004, 2005 and 2007, respectively), especially in drier years,
   indicating that under short water supply the water use efficiency of
   castor plants was very low. The seed oil content varied from 33.6\% to
   49.2\% by weight. There was also a strong correlation between castor
   yield and daily ET (R-2 = 0.9433, RMSE = 91.1 kg ha(-1)), and between
   castor yield and rainfall (R-2 = 0.9902, RMSE = 30.6 kg ha(-1)). (C)

Abstract = {{We consider the model of the Finnish high-voltage power grid in
   1978-1979, for which the accurate parameters are available for
   calculating geomagnetically induced currents (GIC). Moving the grid at
   different locations across Europe gives estimates of GIC levels in this
   region. For calculating the geoelectric field driving GIC, we use
   different layered models of the ground conductivity and 1 min
   geomagnetic data of the year 2003. The results show a clear
   concentration of large GIC in north Europe, where the peak values are
   about 3-5 times larger than in Central and South Europe, being up to
   about 200 A in this specific power grid. There are two factors
   contributing to this finding. First, geomagnetic variations are
   generally stronger in the north. Second, there are regions in the north
   with clearly smaller ground conductivities than typically at other
   areas. Both of these reasons lead to larger electric fields in the
   north. A very similar behavior of GIC is found in the case when a
   single-layered ground conductivity model is assumed everywhere. We also
   show that the geographic characteristics of GIC are quite insensitive to
   the details of the power grid model by modifying various parameters of
   the Finnish grid.}},

Abstract = {{Pear trees (Pyrus bretschneideri Rehd) play an important role in the
   fruit production in the North China Plain (NCP) where water shortage is
   a serious problem. The objectives of this research were to explore the
   characteristics of water balance, energy transfer and carbon exchange of
   irrigated pear orchards by a combination of multiple measurement methods
   (eddy covariance system, sap flow method, and the other equipment).
   Experiments from 08/01/2011 to 10/31/2012 were conducted in a pear
   orchard located in the NCP. Annual net radiation (Rn) was 2490 MJ m(-2)
   of which latent heat flux accounted for 74.5\%, a little higher than the
   agro-ecosystem with wheat-maize rotation (70\%). Annual mean water use
   efficient (WUE) was 1.98 g CO2/kg H2O which was lower than the
   agro-ecosystem in the same area. Annual evapotranspiration (ET) was 759
   mm and daily transpiration (T) ranged from 0.5 to 4.3 mm during May to
   October while daily T/ET varied from 0.6 to 0.9. Variation of ET can be
   explained well by the change of LAI. As annual drainage was 86 mm, it
   will take a long time for the shallow soil water (0-140 cm) to replenish
   deep groundwater. Optimal values of daily downward short wave radiation
   (Rs) (20 MJ m(-2) d(-1)) and ET (similar to 4.8 mm d(-1)) were probably
   important thresholds for the plant growth. Changing irrigation method
   and crops planting structure adjusting according to the water balance
   and trees growth characteristics, were probably useful for keeping high
   yield with less water depletion while further research should be done in
   future. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{There is a rapidly increasing demand for hydropower in China. However,
   little research has been conducted to systematically investigate the
   overall aspects of hydropower development risks. With support of the
   data collected from a fieldwork survey, this study reports the multiple
   facets of hydropower development risks in China as perceived by main
   project participants. All groups have a common view on the criticality
   of safety, and the groups also have their own priorities, i.e.,
   resettlement of migrants, incompetence of subcontractors, project delay,
   inadequate or incorrect design, premature failure of facilities and
   ecological and environmental impacts are the key risks to clients,
   whereas quality of work, financial related risks, reputation, and claims
   and disputes are the main concerns to contractors. A case study of Three
   Gorges Project further demonstrates that, hydropower development risks
   can be effectively managed by encouraging joint efforts of all
   participants to achieve the goals on producing renewable energy,
   reducing emissions of CO2, and providing important social/economical
   benefits. Future hydropower development should emphasize the
   interactions between project delivery, environmental, and economical
   processes to reach appropriate trade-offs among involving stakeholders,

Pages = {{7837-7851}},

Abstract = {{The flows of energy and water from ocean to land are examined in the
   context of the land energy and water budgets, for land as a whole and
   for continents. Most atmospheric reanalyses have large errors of up to
   15 W m(-2) in the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy imbalance, and none
   include volcanic eruptions. The flow of energy from ocean to land is
   more reliable as it relies on analyzed wind, temperature, and moisture
   fields. It is examined for transports of the total, latent energy (LE),
   and dry static energy (DSE) to land as a whole and as zonal means. The
   net convergence of energy onto land is balanced by the loss of energy at
   TOA, measured by Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES),
   and again there are notable discrepancies. Only the ECMWF Interim
   Re-Analysis (ERA-I) is stable and plausible. Strong compensation between
   variations in LE and DSE transports onto land means that their sum is
   more stable over time, and the net transport of energy onto land is
   largely that associated with the hydrological cycle (LE). A more
   detailed examination is given of the energy and water budgets for
   Eurasia, North and South America, Australia, and Africa, making use of
   Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data for water storage
   on land and data on river discharge into the ocean. With ERA-I, the new
   land estimates for both water and energy are closer to achieving
   balances than in previous studies. As well as the annual means, the mean
   annual cycles are examined in detail along with uncertainty sampling
   estimates, but the main test used here is that of closure.}},

Abstract = {{Regional ecological degradation induced by hydroelectric project
   construction (HPC) is of great concern in the field of landscape ecology
   research. Using GIS-based spatial analysis, we predicted and assessed
   the impacts of HPC on the ecological integrity of the Nuozhadu Nature
   Reserve (NNR). The results show that, after Nuozhadu HPC, the naturality
   of the NNR will be modified due to changes in the landscape composition
   such that larger areas covered by vegetation will be occupied by
   construction land and flooded by water areas. Meanwhile, landscape
   diversity will increase due to the additional landscape types of
   construction land and submerged areas, while landscape stability will
   decrease because of the splitting and contagion of the landscape after
   Nuozhadu HPC. The human disturbance index shows that the HPC will
   contribute to increasing the disturbance of the ecosystem. From buffer
   analyses, we conclude that the impacts of HPC will mainly occur in
   buffer zones over the distance of 800 m from the Lancang River in the
   NNR, and tend to be moderate in the 800-5,000 m buffer zone. Therefore,
   within the 800 m buffer zone, taking the naturality, diversity and
   stability of the ecosystem as well as anthropogenic interference as
   evaluation indicators, we calculated the ecological integrity index; the
   results indicate that the ecological integrity of the NNR will decrease

Abstract = {{We studied a population of Ameerega flavopicta on an island in

   1965. We studied frog condition factor, diet composition (through
   induced regurgitation), prey preferences (based on prey availability
   assessed at frogs' habitats), vocalizations, breeding period, and
   density. We conducted fieldwork monthly from July 2008 to March 2010 to
   locate frogs in marked grids. We photographed individual frogs to
   register particular patterns of dots on the dorsum that allowed
   individual recognition. During the rainy season A. flavopicta used a
   temporary trench inside the inland vegetation (Cerradao) for tadpole
   development. The frogs migrated to the margins of the reservoir during
   the dry season, when the trench dried completely. Frogs measured 24.0
   +/- 4.0 mm (snout vent length), and mass was 1.6 +/- 0.5 g (N = 47).
   Their condition varied among months but not between the two areas used
   (trench surroundings inland and island shores). Ameerega flavopicta
   favored specific food items and preferred Lepidoptera larvae in both
   areas. The advertisement call was composed of simple notes repeated
   102.7 +/- 7.63 times per min, lasting 166 +/- 42 msec and spaced by 387
   +/- 66 msec. The breeding period differed from that reported for other
   areas. This and other aspects of the Pirapitinga population differed
   from populations studied elsewhere. Differences may be attributable to a
   bottleneck effect or different selective pressures in this isolated

Abstract = {{China's electricity sector faces the challenge of managing cost
   increases, improving reliability, and reducing its environmental
   footprint even as operating conditions become more complex due to
   increasing renewable penetration, growing peak demand, and falling
   system load factors. Addressing these challenges will require changes in
   how power generation is planned, priced, and dispatched in China. This
   is especially true for natural gas generation, which is likely to play
   an important role in power systems worldwide as a flexible generation
   resource. Although natural gas is commonly perceived to be economically
   uncompetitive with coal in China, these perceptions are based on
   analysis that fails to account. for the different roles that natural gas
   generation plays in power systems-baseload, load following, and peaking
   generation. Our analysis shows that natural gas generation is already

Abstract = {{Methods for reconstruction of river runoff have been an important
   component of paleo-climatology and paleo-hydrology. The lower Heihe
   River was studied from 2002 to 2008 to reconstruct the annual average
   runoff at the Zhengyi Gorges hydrological station using measured data
   and improved water and energy balance equations. The results indicate
   that the reconstructed annual runoff and the measured runoff values are
   not equivalent. However, the difference between reconstructed and
   measured runoff values is within 10 \%, which suggests that water and
   energy balance models can successfully reconstruct runoff from rivers in
   arid regions. Regional differences imply that parameters must be
   corrected when applying water and energy balance equations to prevent
   large errors. In addition, the latent heat of evaporation in arid lakes
   is greater than their net radiation, according to latent and sensible
   heat calculations, which demonstrates the existence of the ``cold island

   quantitatively investigated the relationships among them by developing

   confirming owners' capabilities on obtaining scarce and valued

   participant's resources, but also critical to appropriately deal with
   hydropower projects' externalities for achieving the objectives on

   history of providing electricity in the region. After a period with
   limited interest in applications of small hydropower, in all five
   countries, a range of stakeholders from policy makers to developers are
   showing a renewed interest in small hydropower. Although different
   models were followed, all five countries covered in the paper do
   currently see activities around grid connected small scale hydropower.
   Particular frameworks that facilitate IPPs and Power Purchase Agreements
   with the national utility do provide a basis for (local) commercial
   banks to provide finance. Off-grid hydropower for rural electrification
   purposes sees activities in the countries with an active (support) role
   of government in this respect only. Small hydropower, renewable energy
   technology has large potential across the southern Africa region, both
   for grid connected and off-grid applications. Historically, small
   hydropower played an important role in the development of the region.
   Since the mid-1960s, however, the main emphasis has been on centralised

Abstract = {{A new, general analytical representation of potential energy surfaces
   (PES) for triatomic molecules is developed. It is based on a novel,
   angular-dependent form of the Morse potential extended to two bonds. The
   very compact analytical form needs only a few adjustable parameters
   while yielding a physically sound description of the global behaviour of
   the interactions in the entire configuration space. As a first example,
   the global PES of the lowest adiabatic state of water monomer (H2O) is
   reviewed. Parameters were adjusted to sets of energy points obtained
   from ab initio calculations at the coupled cluster and multi-reference
   configuration interaction level of theory. Experimental vibrational band
   centres of levels below 5000 cm(-1) are correctly reproduced to within
   3cm(-1); higher lying levels are less well described than in previously
   determined PES representations which involved a substantially extended
   set of adjustable parameters. Spectroscopic and thermodynamic data as
   well as reaction barriers are overall qualitatively well reproduced. The
   representation is suitable to describe semi-quantitatively the
   recombination (S-2)H + ((2)Pi)OH = ((1)A(1))H2O as well as abstraction
   reaction (S-2)H + ((2)Pi)OH = ((1)Sigma(+)(g))H-2 + (P-3)O in the limit
   of low collision energies. As a second example, the first global PES of
   the copper nitrosyl molecule (CuNO) is presented. The equilibrium
   structure with a bent Cu-N-O connectivity and the dissociation energy
   match the currently best known values from ab initio calculations
   (Krishna and Marquardt, J. Chem. Phys.136, 244303 (2012)) and
   vibrational band centres agree well with previously published
   experimental data from matrix isolation spectroscopy for various
   isotopologues. A high lying metastable state with the linear
   connectivity N-Cu-O is predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Water is required for energy supply, and energy is required for water
   supply, creating problems as demand for both resources grows. We analyze
   this ``water-energy nexus{''} as it affects long-run electricity
   planning in the western United States. We develop four scenarios
   assuming: no new constraints; limits on carbon emissions; limits on
   water use; and combined carbon and water limits.
   We evaluate these scenarios through 2100 under a range of carbon and
   water prices. The carbon-reducing scenarios become cost-effective at
   carbon prices of about \$50-\$70 per ton of CO2, moderately high but
   plausible within the century. In contrast, the water-conserving
   scenarios are not cost-effective until water prices reach thousands of
   dollars per acre-foot, well beyond foreseeable levels. This is due in
   part to the modest available water savings: our most and least
   water-intensive scenarios differ by less than 1\% of the region's water
   consumption.
   Under our assumptions, Western electricity generation could be reshaped
   by the cost of carbon emissions, but not by the cost of water, over the
   course of this century. Both climate change and water scarcity are of
   critical importance, but only in the former is electricity generation
   central to the problem and its solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Studies seeking to understand the impacts of climate variability and
   change on the hydrology of a region need to take into account the
   dynamics of vegetation and its interaction with the hydrologic and
   energy cycles. Yet, most of the hydrologic models used for these kinds

   dynamic, spatially explicit model that couples a vertical energy balance
   scheme (surface and canopy layer) to a hydrologic model and a forest
   growth component to capture the dynamic interactions between energy,
   vegetation, and hydrology at hourly to daily time scales. The model is
   designed to be forced with outputs from regional climate models. Lateral
   water transfers are simulated using a 1D kinematic wave model.
   Infiltration is simulated using the Green and Ampt approximation to
   Richard's equation. The dynamics of soil moisture and energy drives
   carbon assimilation and forest growth, which in turn affect the
   distribution of energy and water through leaf dynamics by altering light
   interception, shading, and enhanced transpiration. The model is
   demonstrated in two case studies simulating energy, water, and
   vegetation dynamics at two different spatial and temporal scales.}},

   Scarcity of geographical, climate and statistical data was the main

   regulated by head and its durability available at site depending upon

Abstract = {{Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (D-InSAR) has
   become a useful technique for monitoring ground movement. The technique
   enables the analysis of very small ground movements in continuous, large
   areas and has the advantages of high accuracy, high resolution,
   all-weather adaptability, low cost, and inaccessible area coverage.
   Thus, D-InSAR has been widely used in the investigation of geologic
   hazards, such as subsidence, landslide, earthquake, and volcanic
   activity. In this paper, D-InSAR is used to locate and monitor landslide
   movement in the wide area of Wudongde Hydropower Reservoir in Jinsha
   River, China. Five SAR acquisitions are obtained by using the phased
   array-type L-band synthetic aperture radar sensor of the Advanced Land
   Observing Satellite. Detailed moving displacement maps in two time
   periods are derived by using the D-InSAR technique, and potentially
   moving landslide areas, as well as landslide hazard areas, are then
   located. The L1R-6 landslide, which is in active state, is investigated
   in detail. The deforming tendency obtained via D-InSAR is consistent
   with that obtained via global positioning system (GPS) monitoring. Error
   analysis of the D-InSAR results is also conducted. Finally, the grid
   function interpolation method of error reduction, which combines D-InSAR

   monitoring and is further verified by the considerable improvement in
   the accuracy of L1R-6 landslide monitoring.}},

   global river discharge and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) leaf area index and reflectance) observational datasets spanning
   different spatial scales. Multiple calibration datasets are expected to
   provide tighter model constraints, better global coverage and reduced
   observational bias. Uncertainties, estimated using a Monte-Carlo
   analysis, are quite large in the global simulation. Nevertheless, the
   present study reveals an inconsistency in measured carbon and water
   fluxes at site level compared to regional/global level. The model, once
   tuned at site-level, predicts a carbon sink of 20 +/- 14 Gt yr(-1) for
   the tropics which is inconsistent with atmospheric CO2 inversion and
   carbon inventory. Furthermore, evapotranspiration recorded at FLUXNET
   sites would have to be reduced by 30\% to agree with measured global
   river discharge. Future modelling would benefit from complementary flux
   measurements in currently underrepresented global vegetation classes
   (tropical broadleaf forest and C4 grassland) and climate zones (tundra).

Abstract = {{We describe the implementation of a new bare-soil evaporation
   formulation in the Community Land Model-version 4 (CLM4). This new
   formulation comprises two components: (1) a full-range (desiccated to
   fully saturated) soil water retention curve (SWRC) parameterization that
   extends the classical Clapp-Hornberger parameterization and (2) a
   mechanistically based formulation of soil resistance that considers the
   effects of water vapor diffusion and liquid mass flow. Predictions by
   the new SWRC parameterization matched measured soil matric pressure data
   across a wide soil moisture range for six very different soils. We
   assessed the revised bare-soil evaporation formulation with two types of
   global simulations, one with prescribed satellite plant phenology and
   the other with bare-soil conditions. Compared with the default CLM4 soil
   evaporation formulation, the revised model leads to (1) slightly lower
   (-0.2 approximate to 0 mm d(-1) averaged annually) bare-soil evaporation
   in moderately wet regions; (2) slightly higher (0 approximate to 0.2 mm
   d(-1) averaged annually) bare-soil evaporation in semiarid regions; (3)
   small changes in global surface energy and water balances across all
   temporal scales for both vegetated and nonvegetated simulations; and (4)
   a small reduction (-0.2 approximate to 0 mm d(-1) averaged annually) in
   the current overestimation of evapotranspiration in densely vegetated
   regions such as the Amazon basin. However, contrary to expectation and
   consistent with the default CLM4, the simulated bare-soil
   evapotranspiration remains higher than that of the vegetated soil in the
   same grid cells. We conclude that further studies are needed to identify
   the processes that lead to the overestimation of bare-soil evaporation
   in CLM4.}},

Abstract = {{Electric power generation often involves the use of water for power
   plant cooling and steam generation, which typically involves the release
   of cooling water to nearby rivers and lakes. The resulting thermal
   pollution may negatively impact the ecosystems of these water bodies.
   Water resource systems models enable the examination of the implications
   of alternative electric generation on regional water resources. This
   letter documents the development, calibration, and validation of a
   climate-driven water resource systems model of the
   Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint, the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa, and the
   Tombigbee River basins in the states of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida,
   in the southeastern US. The model represents different water users,
   including power plants, agricultural water users, and municipal users.
   The model takes into account local population, per-capita use estimates,
   and changes in population growth. The water resources planning model was
   calibrated and validated against the observed, managed flows through the
   river systems of the three basins. Flow calibration was performed on
   land cover, water capacity, and hydraulic conductivity of soil horizons;
   river water temperature calibration was performed on channel width and
   slope properties. Goodness-of-fit statistics indicate that under
   1980-2010 levels of water use, the model robustly represents major
   features of monthly average streamflow and water temperatures. The
   application of this integrated electricity generation-water resources
   planning model can be used to explore alternative electric generation
   and water implications. The implementation of this model is explored in
   the companion paper of this focus issue (Yates et al 2013 Environ. Res.
   Lett. 8 035042).}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the oviposition behavior of mosquito species exhibiting
   acrodendrophilic habits was investigated. The study was conducted near
   the Simplocio Hydroelectic Reservoir (SHR) located on the border of the
   states of Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Samples were
   collected using oviposition traps installed in forest vegetation cover
   between 1.70 and 4.30 m above ground level during the months of April,
   June, August, October, and December of 2011. Haemagogus janthinomys
   (Dyar), Haemagogus leucocelaenus (Dyar and Shannon), Aedes albopictus
   (Skuse), and Aedes terrens (Walker) specimens were present among the
   collected samples, the first two of which being proven vectors of
   sylvatic yellow fever (SYF) in Brazil and the latter is a vector of
   dengue in mainland Asia. As the data set was zero-inflated, a specific
   Poisson-based model was used for the statistical analysis. When all four
   species were considered in the model, only heights used for egg laying
   and months of sampling were explaining the distribution. However,
   grouping the species under the genera Haemagogus Williston and Aedes
   Meigen showed a significant preference for higher traps of the former.
   Considering the local working population of SHR is very large,
   fluctuating, and potentially exposed to SYF, and that this virus occurs
   in almost all Brazilian states, monitoring of Culicidae in Brazil is
   essential for assessing the risk of transmission of this arbovirus.}},

Abstract = {{Power systems as one of the key infrastructures play a crucial role in
   any country's economy and social life. A large-scale blackout can affect
   all sectors in a society such as industrial, commercial, residential,
   and essential public services. However, the frequency of large-scale
   blackouts across the world is not being reduced, although advanced
   technology and huge investment have been applied into power systems.
   Given a single blackout, it is possible to analyze the causes with the
   traditional engineering methods. What we want to do is not to explain
   the causes of blackouts but to find what are the most critical elements
   of the power system to improve the resilience of the system itself. As
   blackout can happen in different load conditions, we do not want a
   method that depends on the load/generation level. We want a method
   independent from these factors: This is the structural perspective.
   When the interconnection between European and Russian power grids will
   create the largest interconnected power grid throughout the world in
   terms of the scale, transmission distance, and involved countries,
   analyzing the vulnerability of a large-scale power grid will be useful
   to maintain its reliable and secure operation. To analyze the
   vulnerability of the interconnected power grid, in this article, we
   first created the interconnected transmission network between
   continental Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and
   Baltic countries; then, the structural vulnerability of the
   interconnected power grid was analyzed from a topological point of view
   using our proposed extended topological method, which incorporates some
   electrical engineering characteristics into complex network methodology.
   We found that these power grids of continental Europe, the Baltic
   states, and the CIS countries can benefit from the interconnection
   because the interconnected power grid can not only improve the overall
   network performance of these power grids in the Baltic states and the
   CIS countries but also increase their structural robustness. Copyright

Abstract = {{Globally, diadromous species are at risk from fragmentation by damming
   of rivers, and a host of other anthropogenic factors. On the United
   States Atlantic Coast, where diadromous fish populations have undergone
   dramatic declines, restoration programs based on fishway construction
   and hatcheries have sustained remnant populations, but large-scale
   restoration has not been achieved. We examine anadromous fish
   restoration programs on three large Atlantic Coast rivers, the
   Susquehanna, Connecticut, and Merrimack with multiple mainstem
   hydropower dams, most with relatively low generating capacity. Mean
   passage efficiencies through fishways on these rivers from the first dam
   to the spawning grounds for American shad are less than 3\%. The result
   is that only small fractions of targeted fish species are able to
   complete migrations. It may be time to admit failure of fish passage and
   hatchery-based restoration programs and acknowledge that significant
   diadromous species restoration is not possible without dam removals. The
   approach being employed on the Penobscot River, where dams are being
   removed or provided the opportunity to increase power generation within
   a plan to provide increased access to habitat, offers a good model for
   restoration. Dammed Atlantic Coastal rivers offer a cautionary tale for

   lasting ecosystem-wide impacts cannot be compensated for through fish

   of the dry season (when the cost of energy is more expensive) there is a
   greater availability of wind and solar energy. This makes investments in

   stronger effects on plant richness, but weaker effects on vertebrate
   richness than energy availability. We conducted piecewise linear
   regressions to detect the breakpoints in the relationship between
   species richness and potential evapotranspiration which divided Xinjiang
   into low and high energy regions. The concordance between mammal and
   plant richness was stronger in high than in low energy regions, which
   was opposite to that between birds and plants. Plant richness had
   stronger effects than climate on mammal richness regardless of energy

Abstract = {{Tropical rainforest regions have large hydropower generation potential

   Feasibility studies of hydropower plants typically ignore the effect of
   future deforestation or assume that deforestation will have a positive
   effect on river discharge and energy generation resulting from declines
   in evapotranspiration (ET) associated with forest conversion. Forest
   loss can also reduce river discharge, however, by inhibiting rainfall.
   We used land use, hydrological, and climate models to examine the local
   ``direct{''} effects (through changes in ET within the watershed) and
   the potential regional ``indirect{''} effects (through changes in
   rainfall) of deforestation on river discharge and energy generation
   potential for the Belo Monte energy complex, one of the world's largest
   hydropower plants that is currently under construction on the Xingu
   River in the eastern Amazon. In the absence of indirect effects of
   deforestation, simulated deforestation of 20\% and 40\% within the Xingu
   River basin increased discharge by 4-8\% and 10-12\%, with similar
   increases in energy generation. When indirect effects were considered,
   deforestation of the Amazon region inhibited rainfall within the Xingu
   Basin, counterbalancing declines in ET and decreasing discharge by
   6-36\%. Under business-as-usual projections of forest loss for 2050
   (40\%), simulated power generation declined to only 25\% of maximum
   plant output and 60\% of the industry's own projections. Like other
   energy sources, hydropower plants present large social and environmental
   costs. Their reliability as energy sources, however, must take into

Abstract = {{Two extremely intense rockbursts took place during the excavation of the
   drainage tunnel and headrace tunnel No. 4 at the Jinping II hydropower
   station in southwestern China. The geological conditions, damage, and
   failure of the surrounding rock mass at the sections where the
   rockbursts occurred were surveyed and are described here with a focus on
   the development of the damage to the rock mass and the mechanism by
   which it occurred. The numerical method based on the Cohesion Weakening
   and Friction Strengthening model and various indices, including the
   failure approaching index and the local energy release rate, were
   adapted for these purposes. The results shown here may help us
   understand the generation and process of development of rockbursts and
   evaluate the degree of failure in the rockmass. This information may be
   valuable in the study and design of rockburst-resistant measures in deep
   tunnels.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how the surface energy budget and evaporation over inland
   waters respond to climate change and variability remains limited. Here
   we report 2 year measurements of the surface energy budget using the
   eddy covariance method over Ross Barnett Reservoir, Mississippi, USA,
   for 2008 and 2009. Annual mean sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes
   in 2008 were 9.5\%, and 10.0\% greater than in 2009, respectively. Most
   of the interannual variations in the surface energy fluxes and
   meteorological variables primarily occurred in the cool seasons from
   October to March, which was enhanced by frequent large wind events
   associated with cold front passages. These large wind events greatly
   promoted H and LE exchange and produced H and LE pulses that increased
   variations in H and LE between these two cool seasons. In the warm
   seasons from April to September, H and LE pulses were also present,
   which largely increased variations in LE and dampened those in H between
   the two warm seasons. The H and LE pulses contributed to approximately
   50\% of the annual H and 28\% of the annual LE, although they only
   covered about 16\% of the entire year. The interannual variations in H
   and LE pulses contributed to about 78\% of the interannual variations in
   H and 40\% of those in LE. Our results imply that the increased
   interannual variability in cold front activities as a result of climate
   change would amplify interannual variations in the evaporation and the
   surface energy exchange over inland waters in this region.}},

Abstract = {{This is a first analysis of end-use energy intensity (EUEI) and

   W/WW infrastructures in Indian cities were analyzed and compared with
   data for cities in the United States. Data gathered by ICLEI-South Asia,
   Government of India, and the University of Colorado Denver were used to
   conduct this analysis. W/WW infrastructures were found to contribute
   3-16\% of community-wide electricity use and GHG emissions for 16 cities
   in India; for another 23 cities, the proportion was less than 3\%. EUEI
   for drinking water supply and wastewater treatment averaged 0.3 +/- 0.2
   W . h/L(n = 7) and 0.1 +/- 0.05 W.h/ L(n = 5), respectively. EUEI for
   drinking water provision was more than double that for wastewater
   treatment, the reverse of typical cities in Colorado, likely a result of
   poorer source water quality in India. In general, although the sample

Abstract = {{Laxiwa Hydropower Station is the largest among those hydropower stations
   in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. The construction started in
   October 2001, diversion tunnel was finished in January 2004, and
   impoundment started in March 2009. However, from May 2009, the
   right-bank slope of the reservoir about 700 m high and 1,000 m wide
   located 500 m far from the dam was found to be deforming greatly and
   continuously. Although this slope had been identified as an old
   landslide, the survey before the construction of the dam concluded that
   this slope being composed of granite is stable and would be stable even
   after the impoundment, and thus no detailed monitoring of the slope
   deformation had been performed before the visible deformation occurred
   after the impoundment. To indentify the relationship between the
   deformation of the slope and impoundment, we utilized differential
   synthetic aperture radar interferometry and Advanced Land Observing
   Satellite Prism data to analyze the slope deformation before and after
   impoundment. We found that no identifiable deformation took place before
   the impoundment, while during the period of 3 April 2009 to 22 May 2010,

Abstract = {{Many developing countries like India are facing energy crisis due to
   increase in industrialization for various development programs. If this
   increase in demand is supplied from coal based thermal power plants, it
   will cause environment pollution and high cost of generation. So the
   best solution is to develop hydropower and small hydro power (SHP)
   plants in the country. India is endowed with these resources which are
   both viable and economically, exploitable. In fact, hydro power is the
   second highest contributor of the energy consumed in the Indian power
   sector. At the present time, it is the only clean energy source that can
   be commercially developed on a large as well as small scale. Recently,
   hydropower and SHP have considered as most readily available, renewable
   and clean sources of electricity. They use the potential energy of
   rivers and supply more than 20\% of total India's electricity. SHP has
   also some advantages: They may be connected to conventional electrical
   distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy.
   Alternatively, SHP projects may be built in isolated areas that would be
   uneconomic to serve from a network, or in areas where there is no
   national electrical distribution network so as to improve the quality of
   life. Therefore, this paper has been focused on the efforts to analyze
   the current status, future strategies and policies of hydropower
   development in India with special emphasis on SHP. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{103-114}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Population growth, economic development, urbanization, changes in
   hydrological regimes and land use are the main drivers affecting
   allocation and exploitation of water resources. The pressure exerted by
   these global changes on the five countries -Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,
   Paraguay and Uruguay- located in La Plata Basin over the last decades
   has raised the need for assessing trends in future electricity demand
   and energy production in the basin.
   The aim of this research is to assess whether (and when) shortage and
   vulnerabilities in terms of hydropower generation are to be expected in
   La Plata basin in the next decades. The methodology proposed has focused
   on two aspects to reach the objectives: 1) assessment of hydropower
   production and electricity demand in the basin over the last twenty
   years (1987-2008), in order to establish growing trends for the next
   thirty years; 2) computation of maximum potential hydropower using the
   newly developed Arc-GIS based tool VAPIDRO-ASTE. The assessment and
   calculation have been applied to La Plata River and its main
   tributaries: Paranaiba, Grande River, Tiete, Paranapanema, Iguacu,
   Uruguay, Negro River, Paraguay and Parana.
   The first outcomes of this research show that La Plata Basin has high
   hydropower potential. About 40\% of the hydropower potential is already
   used to produce and supply energy. Out of the remaining 60\% potential,
   about 25\% could hardly be exploited because of environmental issues or
   low cost/benefit ratio. Thus, the estimated residual potential
   hydropower is about 35\% of the maximum potential hydropower calculated.

Abstract = {{The large-scale construction of water conservancy and hydropower
   projects brings huge social and economic benefits, and thus, the social
   development is promoted; however, with huge amount of land expropriated,
   involuntary resettlement has become a bigger issue of concern. The
   resettlement compensation system of water conservancy and hydropower
   projects in the New China has undergone three stages in history: the
   stage of land acquisition approach, the stage of land acquisition
   regulations and the stage of land management law. After a thorough
   research of the current resettlement compensation system of water
   conservancy and hydropower projects in China, this essay initiates
   several new methods to the innovation of resettlement compensation
   system in China on the basis of long-term resettlement compensation

   samples were collected on 14 (CI14), 18 (CI18) and 25 (CI25) February
   2008. Eight primers using RAPD technique were evaluated. Seventy-nine in
   105 fragments amplified using these primers were polymorphic fragments
   (75.2\%), 32 had frequencies with significant differences (P<0.05), 10
   had low frequencies, 25 were excluded, and four were fixed fragments.
   One exclusive fragment was found in the CI14 sample. High values for
   polymorphic fragments and genetic diversity index of Shannon were
   observed for the CI14 and CI18. Low ancestry levels among the groups
   were indicated by the F-ST values that indicated high genetic
   differentiation. In all the three groups, the estimates of the number of
   migrants by generation (Nm) indicated low levels of gene flow. Most of
   the genetic variation was found within the groups through the AMOVA

Pages = {{1330-1340}},
Abstract = {{Water used in agriculture consumes much energy, mainly due to pumping
   water for irrigation, but the water-energy nexus is always neglected in
   arid and semi-arid areas. Based on hydrological observation data,
   irrigation data and socioeconomic data over the past 50 yr, this study
   has derived a detailed estimate of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
   agricultural water use in the Minqin Oasis. Results show that the
   decreasing water supply and increasing demand for agriculture has caused
   severe water deficits over the past 50 yr in this region. The
   groundwater energy use rate rose by 76\% between 1961 and 2009 because
   of the serious decline in groundwater levels. An increase in pump lift
   by an average 1 m would cause GHG emission rates to rise by around 2\%.
   Over the past 10 yr, the GHG emissions from groundwater accounted for
   65-88\% of the total emissions from agricultural water. GHG emissions
   for diverted water varied from 0.047 to 0.074 Mt CO(2)e as the water
   input increased. Long distance conveyance and high pump lifts need more
   electricity input than groundwater abstraction does. Government policies
   have had a favorable effect on total emissions by reducing water
   abstraction. But groundwater depletion, exacerbated by a growing
   population and an expansion in arable land, remains the principal
   energy-water nexus challenge in the region. In response to the
   increasing water-energy crisis, energy-saving irrigation technology,
   matching to cost efficiencies, and better coordination between different
   infrastructural agencies could be feasible ways of rendering the water
   and energy sectors more sustainable over the long term.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{1363-1370}},
Abstract = {{While the shortage of water and energy is a well-recognized worldwide
   natural resources issue, little attention has been given to irrigation
   energy efficiency. In this paper, we examine the potential energy
   savings that can be achieved by implementing improved irrigation
   technologies in China. The use of improved irrigation management
   measures such as a flow meter, irrigation scheduling, and/or regular
   maintenance and upgrades, typically reduces the amount of water pumped
   over the course of a growing season. The total energy saved by applying
   these improved measures could reach 20\%, as compared with traditional
   irrigation methods. Two methods of irrigation water conveyance by
   traditional earth canal and low pressure pipeline irrigation (LPPI) were
   also evaluated. Our study indicated that LPPI could save 6.48 x 10(9)
   kWh yr(-1) when applied to 11 Chinese provinces. Also, the CO2 emission
   was reduced by 6.72 metric tons per year. Among these 11 surveyed
   provinces, the energy saving potential for two provinces, Hebei and
   Shandong, could reach 1.45 x 10(9) kWh yr(-1). Using LPPI, potential
   energy saved and CO2 emissions reduced in the other 20 Chinese provinces
   were estimated at about 2.97 x 10(9) kWh yr(-1) and 2.69 metric tons per
   year, respectively. The energy saving potential for Heilongjiang, a
   major agriculture province, could reach 1.77 x 10(9) kWh yr(-1), which
   is the largest in all provinces. If LPPI is applied to the entire
   country, average annual energy saving of more than 9 billion kWh and
   average annual CO2 emission reduction of more than 9.0 metric tons could
   be realized. Rice is one of the largest users of the world's fresh water
   resources. Compared with continuous flooding irrigation, intermittent
   irrigation (ITI) can improve yield and water-use efficiency in paddy
   fields. The total increments of net output energy and yield by ITI in
   paddy fields across China could reach 2.5 x 10(16) calories and 10(7)
   tons, respectively. So far only a small part of agricultural land in
   China has adopted water and energy saving technologies. Therefore,
   potential water and energy savings in China by adapting improved
   irrigation technology could be significant and should be carefully
   studied and applied.}},

Abstract = {{Two important features of the high slopes at Gushui Hydropower Station
   are layered accumulations (rock-soil aggregate) and multilevel toppling
   failures of plate rockmasses; the Gendakan slope is selected for case
   study in this paper. Geological processes of the layered accumulation of
   rock and soil particles are carried out by the movement of water flow;
   the main reasons for the toppling failure of plate rock masses are the
   increasing weight of the upper rock-soil aggregate and mountain erosion
   by river water. Indoor triaxial compression test results show that, the
   cohesion and friction angle of the rock-soil aggregate decreased with
   the increasing water content; the cohesion and the friction angle for
   natural rock-soil aggregate are 57.7 kPa and 31.3 degrees and 26.1 kPa
   and 29.1 degrees for saturated rock-soil aggregate, respectively. The
   deformation and failure mechanism of the rock-soil aggregate slope is a
   progressive process, and local landslides will occur step by step.
   Three-dimensional limit equilibrium analysis results show that the
   minimum safety factor of Gendakan slope is 0.953 when the rock-soil
   aggregate is saturated, and small scale of landslide will happen at the

Abstract = {{Most countries in the Middle East \& North Africa (MENA) region
   currently face water scarcity and rising water demand. In order to
   respond to these challenges, many MENA countries proceed to the use of

   use of conventional energy for the operation of desalination plants
   contributes to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions, with
   negative impacts on the water cycle. The use of renewable energy sources
   to supply desalination plants with electricity can be a more sustainable

   The present paper outlines the main barriers to desalination using

   features of the water and energy policies in the MENA region, and

Abstract = {{The ever-increasing demand for water due to growth of population and
   socioeconomic development in the past several decades has posed a
   worldwide threat to water supply security and to the environmental
   health of rivers. This study aims to derive reservoir operating rules
   through establishing a multi-objective optimization model for the
   Xinfengjiang (XFJ) reservoir in the East River Basin in southern China
   to minimize water supply deficit and maximize hydropower generation.
   Additionally, to enhance the estimation of irrigation water demand from
   the downstream agricultural area of the XFJ reservoir, a conventional
   method for calculating crop water demand is improved using hydrological
   model simulation results. Although the optimal reservoir operating rules
   are derived for the XFJ reservoir with three priority scenarios (water
   supply only, hydropower generation only, and equal priority), the river
   environmental health is set as the basic demand no matter which scenario
   is adopted. The results show that the new rules derived under the three
   scenarios can improve the reservoir operation for both water supply and
   hydropower generation when comparing to the historical performance.
   Moreover, these alternative reservoir operating policies provide the
   flexibility for the reservoir authority to choose the most appropriate
   one. Although changing the current operating rules may influence its
   hydropower-oriented functions, the new rules can be significant to cope
   with the increasingly prominent water shortage and degradation in the
   aquatic environment. Overall, our results and methods (improved
   estimation of irrigation water demand and formulation of the reservoir
   optimization model) can be useful for local watershed managers and
   valuable for other researchers worldwide. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Water is the source of all the creatures on the earth and energy is the
   main factor driving the world. With the increasing population and global
   change, water and energy conservation have become worldwide focal
   issues, particularly in the water-stressed and energy-limited regions.
   Rainwater harvesting, based on the collection and storage of rainfall
   runoff, has been widely used for domestic use and agricultural
   production in arid and semiarid regions. It has advantages of simple
   operation, high adaption, low cost and less energy consumption. This
   study reviewed rainwater harvesting systems adopted in the Loess Plateau
   of China and analyzed water use efficiency (WUE) for various rainwater
   harvesting techniques. Supplemental irrigation using harvested rainwater
   could increase crop yield by more than 30\%, and WUE ranged from 0.7 to
   5.7 kg m(-3) for spring wheat, corn and flax, and 30-40 kg m(-3) for
   vegetables. Moreover, energy consumption for rainwater harvesting based
   on single family was compared with traditional water supply in the city
   of the Loess Plateau using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method.
   Results showed that energy consumption yielded per unit harvested
   rainwater was 25.96 MJ m(-3) yr(-1) which was much less than 62.25 MJ
   m(-3) yr(-1) for main water supply in Baoji City, Shanxi Province,
   meaning that rainwater harvesting saved energy by 139.8\% as compared to
   the main water supply system. This study highlights the importance and
   potential of rainwater harvesting for water and energy conservation in

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the complementarity between hydroelectricity and
   surplus electricity from sugarcane biomass-based cogeneration plants in
   sugarcane mills. The paper investigates opportunities and barriers in
   the context of governments' initiatives, institutions and prevailing
   regulatory frameworks in Brazil and Nepal. The paper finds that
   bioelectricity from cogeneration can be a good complementary option for
   hydroelectric power, helping foster diversification on the generation
   side and enhance security of electricity supply based on local
   resources. Bioelectricity potential from sugarcane biomass is estimated
   to be in the range of 209-313 GWh for Nepal and 62-93 TWh for Brazil. In
   Nepal, the grid connected bioelectricity can provide power for operating
   industries, and support local development through rural electrification.
   In Brazil, the biomass potential can be further enhanced through a
   better utilization of the biomass in the sugar-ethanol industry to
   balance hydropower availability. This comparative study offers a
   reflection on the need for better planning and policies to address the
   barriers which are hindering the development of bioelectricity even in
   places where the potential is large. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The authors analyzed the surface energy fluxes that were measured by an
   eddy covariance system over the Ross Barnett Reservoir in Mississippi
   for a 1-yr period in 2008. On a monthly basis over the course of the
   year, positive vertical temperature and vapor pressure differences were
   observed, though negative vertical temperature differences occurred
   occasionally during some short periods when overwater air masses were
   warmer than the water surface. Consequently, the unstable atmospheric
   surface layer (ASL) and sufficient mechanical mixing led to positive
   sensible H and latent lambda E heat fluxes. The quantities H and lambda
   E were distinctively out of phase with the net radiation Rn. The H and
   lambda E from the water to the ASL was still substantial on nights with
   a negative Rn and in winter when Rn was very small. From February to
   August, approximately 60\%-91\% of the Rn was used for H and lambda E,
   with the remainder being stored in the water. Fueled by the previously
   stored heat in the water, H and lambda E exceeded Rn by almost 3 times
   from September to January. Nighttime evaporation represented a large
   loss of water (i.e., lambda E = 82.8 W m(-2) at night versus 91.4 W
   m(-2) during the daytime). Intraseasonal and seasonal variations in H
   and lambda E were strongly affected by frequent passages of large-scale
   air masses that were brought in by different synoptic weather systems
   (e.g., cyclones or anticyclones). The authors' analysis suggested that
   this southern reservoir responded to atmospheric forcings on both
   diurnal and seasonal scales in the same ways as northern lakes of
   comparable sizes and depths.}},

   proliferation and cell death during spermatogenesis and serum profiles
   of sex steroids in Prochilodus argenteus, from the So Francisco River,
   downstream from the Trs Marias Dam. A total of 257 adult males were
   caught quarterly during a reproductive cycle in two sites: the first 34
   km of the river after the dam (site 1) and the second 34-54 km after the
   dam (site 2), after the confluence with a tributary, the Abaet, River.
   Seasonal changes in the testicular activity associated with morphometric
   analyses of germ cells as well as proliferation and testicular apoptosis
   support a more active spermatogenesis in fish from site 2, where higher
   levels of sex steroids and gonadosomatic index (GSI) were also found. In
   site 1, fish presented low serum levels of testosterone, 17
   beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and a low GSI during
   gonadal maturation. Spermatogonial proliferation (PCNA) and apoptosis
   (TUNEL) were more elevated in fish from site 1, but spermatocytes were
   mainly labelled in fish from site 2. Overall, these data demonstrate
   changes in testicular activity and plasma sex steroids in a neotropical

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},

Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{358-363}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Due to the dominance of coal power, the electricity sector is the
   primary contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in China. The increase
   of peak-load and intermittent renewable power requires significant
   resources of regulation facilities. Comprehensively utilizing
   large-scale cascade hydropower plants (CHPPs), which are being rapidly
   developed in China, as renewable regulating facilities would be a
   strategic decision, considering the flexibility of hydropower. jointly
   modeling a set of CHPP in the upstream Yangtze River indicated that the
   CHPP can regulate peak-load up to 30-40 W and intermittent renewables to
   scales of nearly 15 GW from wind and solar sources with the help of +/-
   800 KV ultra-high voltage direct current (UHVDC) transmissions. The
   present study shows that the hydraulic stability of the concerned river
   reaches can be preserved easily and the comprehensive efficiency of
   regulation and transmission by CHPPs is much higher than that of pumped
   hydro energy storage (PHES) stations. As increasingly more giant CHPPs
   emerge in west China, using them primarily as regulating facilities can
   enhance the structure of power grids, promote the development of
   renewables, save energy and reduce emissions. Thus we propose to shift
   the CHPPs that were originally projected mainly for electricity to
   facility primarily for power improvement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Rising energy consumption in coming decades, combined with a changing
   energy mix, have the potential to increase the impact of energy sector
   water use on freshwater biodiversity. We forecast changes in future
   water use based on various energy scenarios and examine implications for
   freshwater ecosystems. Annual water withdrawn/manipulated would increase
   by 18-24\%, going from 1,993,000-2,628,000 Mm(3) in 2010 to
   2,359,000-3,271,000 Mm(3) in 2035 under the Reference Case of the Energy
   Information Administration (EIA). Water consumption would more rapidly
   increase by 26\% due to increased biofuel production, going from
   16,700-46,400 Mm(3) consumption in 2010 to 21,000-58,400 Mm(3)
   consumption in 2035. Regionally, water use in the Southwest and
   Southeast may increase, with anticipated decreases in water use in some
   areas of the Midwest and Northeast. Policies that promote energy
   efficiency or conservation in the electric sector would reduce water
   withdrawn/manipulated by 27-36 m(3)GJ(-1) (0.1-0.5 m(3)GJ(-1)
   consumption), while such policies in the liquid fuel sector would reduce
   withdrawal/manipulation by 0.4-0.7 m(3)GJ(-1) (0.2-0.3 m(3) GJ(-1)
   consumption). The greatest energy sector withdrawal/manipulation are for
   hydropower and thermoelectric cooling, although potential new EPA rules
   that would require recirculating cooling for thermoelectric plants would
   reduce withdrawal/manipulation by 441,000 Mm(3) (20,300 Mm(3)
   consumption). The greatest consumptive energy sector use is evaporation
   from hydroelectric reservoirs, followed by irrigation water for biofuel
   feedstocks and water used for electricity generation from coal.
   Historical water use by the energy sector is related to patterns of fish
   species endangerment, where water resource regions with a greater
   fraction of available surface water withdrawn by hydropower or consumed
   by the energy sector correlated with higher probabilities of
   imperilment. Since future increases in energy-sector surface water use
   will occur in areas of high fish endemism (e.g., Southeast), additional
   management and policy actions will be needed to minimize further species
   imperilment.}},

Abstract = {{Damming rivers to generate hydroelectric energy causes a series of
   changes in the environment, including impacts on the ichthyofauna.
   Knowledge of the fish community immediately downstream from a
   hydroelectric dam can help to reduce the negative effects of dam
   operation, such as fish entrance into the draft tube during turbines
   maintenance. We evaluated the temporal variation in fish community
   composition and abundance, near Tres Marias Hydroelectric Dam (TMD), and
   its relationship with abiotic variables. Samples (n = 18) were carried
   out using gill nets in the tailrace of the dam, over the course of a
   hydrological year, at six time points during a 24-hour period. Abiotic
   data were also sampled to assess the relationship with the biotic data.
   In the tailrace, Characiformes showed the highest richness, while
   Siluriformes were the most abundant. Of the 33 species sampled, six were
   migratory. The fish community was significantly different between the
   dry and wet seasons, with higher abundances during the wet season. In
   the wet season, the frequency of migratory species in the community rose
   from 0.7 to 18.3\%, and Pimelodus maculatus accounted for 14.5\% of the
   overall abundance. We observed that Characiformes captures occurred
   mainly in the morning, with peak activity between 5:00 and 9:00 h.
   Siluriformes showed greater nocturnal activity and were largely captured
   between 17:00 and 21:00 h. Synchronizing operational maneuvers that
   represent high risk to the fish with periods of low abundance in the
   tailrace, i.e., during months of low precipitation, may be a measure to
   reduce the impact of the operation on the downstream fish community.}},

   how the leading energy company in the region is preparing to address
   these problems involving economic impacts resulting from the
   environmental effects of climate change. Two prospective methodologies
   were used to select the variables and construct a SWOT matrix, and their
   respective scenarios: A Panel of Experts and the Delphi Method. The
   methodologies used allow for four (4) distinct scenarios to be inferred
   for CHESF up until 2050: Development, Growth, Survival and Decline. The
   analyses of these scenarios concluded that CHESF's main risk from
   climate change is the possible reduction of water flow and reservoir
   levels, which could threaten energy security throughout the country if
   certain preventative adaptations to climate change are not implemented.

Abstract = {{Turkey is a rich country from the point of variety and potential of
   renewable energy resources. Hydros, winds, biomass, solar and geothermal
   are important renewable and environmentally friendly sources for energy
   in Turkey. Turkey produces large amount of hydropower with a total gross
   hydropower potential of 433 TW h/yr, which is equal to 13.8\% of the
   total hydropower Potential of Europe. Technically useable potential is
   216 TW h/yr and economic potential is 140 TW h/yr. The main aim of the
   present study is to investigate hydropower potential of Turkey and small
   hydropower plants in Eastern Black Sea Region for sustainable energy
   development in Turkey. The geography of Turkey especially, Eastern Black
   Sea Region supports and suitable the development of the small hydro

Abstract = {{Shortage of drinking water is chronic, severe, and wide-spread in the
   regions of Northern Africa, Middle East, and Central and Southern Asia.
   Conventional processes like MSF and RO require large amounts of energy
   in the form of thermal energy (for MSF) or electric power (for RO). Most
   desalination plants using these technologies are fossil-fuel driven.
   This results in a large carbon footprint for the desalination plant, and
   sensitivity to the price and availability of oil.
   Decentralized water production is important for regions which have
   neither the infrastructure nor the economic resources to run MSF or RO
   plants and which are sufficiently distant from large scale production
   facilities that pipeline distribution is prohibitive. Many such regions
   are found in the developing world in regions of high incidence of solar
   radiation. Accordingly, the problem of providing arid areas with fresh
   water can be solved by extracting water from Atmospheric air.
   The Atmospheric air is considered a huge and renewable source of fresh
   water. The atmosphere contains about 12,900 km(3) of fresh water,
   whereas liquid water resources of inhabited lands is about 12,500 km(3).
   In this paper, atmospheric water vapor processing (AWVP) technology is
   reviewed. These processors are machines which extract water molecules
   from the atmosphere, ultimately causing a phase change from vapor to
   liquid. Three classes of machines have been proposed. These classes are
   either cool a surface below the dew point of the ambient air,
   concentrate water vapor through use of solid or liquid desiccants, or
   induce and control convection in a tower structure. The review is
   extended to cover different humidification and dehumidification (H-DH)
   techniques in which air is used as a medium to carry water in the form
   of vapor. The study concentrates on the extracting potable water from
   air especially with respect to the remote/rural arid places. Finally,
   different technological processes to extract water from the ambient air
   using solar energy as a power source are focused with discussing their
   strengths and limitations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage stability is a growing concern for the successful planning and
   operation of modern power systems. The prediction of voltage collapse
   point of the multibus power network through its two-bus equivalent model
   is a hot topic of the research in the field of power system operation

   stability status of a power system incorporating the static var
   compensator (SVC) using a unique two-bus pi-network equivalent model
   obtained with the optimal power flow solution of the actual system at
   different operating conditions. The novelty of the proposed methodology
   is that it considers the series and shunt parts of transmission losses
   lumped separately in equivalent series and shunt form to evaluate the
   pi-network equivalent two-bus model. SVC firing angle model is
   integrated into optimal power flow program to investigate its effect on
   power system performance in terms of voltage stability assessed in the
   equivalent two-bus domain. The simulation results for a practical power
   system (203-bus Indian Eastern Grid) have shown that the proposed
   methodology is promising to assess voltage stability of any power system
   at any operating point in global scenario. Voltage stability margin
   augmentation with the application of SVC at the weakest bus is compared
   with the system having no compensation. In the proposed pi-network

Abstract = {{Studies of global hydrologic cycles, carbon cycles and climate change
   are greatly facilitated when. global estimates of evapotranspiration (E)
   are available. We have developed an air-relative-humidity-based
   two-source (ARTS) E model that simulates the surface energy balance,
   soil water balance, and environmental constraints on E. It uses remotely
   sensed leaf area index (L-ai) and surface meteorological data to
   estimate E by: 1) introducing a simple biophysical model for canopy
   conductance (G(c)), defined as a constant maximum stomatal conductance
   g(smax) of 12.2 mm s(-1) multiplied by air relative humidity (R-h) and
   L-ai (G(c) = g(srnax) x R-h X L-ai); 2) calculating canopy transpiration
   with the G(c)-based Penman-Monteith (PM) E model; 3) calculating soil
   evaporation from an air-relative-humidity-based model of
   evapotranspiration (Yan \& Shugart, 2010); 4) calculating total E (E-0)
   as the sum of the canopy transpiration and soil evaporation, assuming
   the absence of soil water stress; and 5) correcting E-0 for soil water
   stress using a soil water balance model.
   This physiological ARTS E model requires no calibration. Evaluation
   against eddy covariance measurements at 19 flux sites, representing a
   wide variety of climate and vegetation types, indicates that daily
   estimated E had a root mean square error = 0.77 mm d(-1). bias = -0.14
   mm d(-1), and coefficient of determination, R-2 = 0.69. Global, monthly,
   0.5 degrees-gridded ARTS E simulations from 1984 to 1998, which were
   forced using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Lai data, Climate
   Research Unit climate data, and surface radiation budget data, predicted
   a mean annual land E of 58.4 x 10(3) km(3). This falls within the range
   (58 x 10(3)-85 x 10(3) km(3)) estimated by the Second Global Soil
   Wetness Project (GSWP-2: Dirmeyer et al., 2006). The ARTS E spatial
   pattern agrees well with that of the global E estimated by GSWP-2. The
   global annual ARTS E increased by 15.5 mm per decade from 1984 to 1998,
   comparable to an increase of 9.9 mm per decade from the model tree
   ensemble approach (Jung et al., 2010). These comparisons confirm the
   effectivity of the ARTS E model to simulate the spatial. pattern and
   climate response of global E. This model is the first of its kind among
   remote-sensing-based PM E models to provide global land E estimation
   with consideration of the soil water balance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The vision of a smart grid is predicated upon pervasive use of modern

   tunable based on the time-scale requirements of the phenomena being

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades; technical, economic and environmental
   benefits of hydroelectric power make it an important contributor to the
   future world energy mix, particularly in the developing countries.
   Turkey has a total gross hydropower potential of 433 GWh/yr, but only
   125 GWh/yr of the total hydroelectric potential of Turkey can be
   economically used. By the commissioning of new hydropower plants, which
   are under construction, 36\% of the economically usable potential of the
   country would be tapped. Turkey's total economically usable small
   hydropower potential is 3.75 GWh/yr. It is expected that the demand for
   electric energy in Turkey will be about 580 billion kWh by the year
   2020. Turkey is heavily dependent on expensive imported energy sources
   that place a big burden on the economy and air pollution is becoming a
   great environmental concern in the country. In this regard, renewable
   energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and
   effective solutions for clean and sustainable energy development in
   Turkey. Environmentally friendly energy development has enormous
   implications for developing countries as major emitters due to their
   rapid economic and population growth. With some possible options, the
   paper concludes that the reduction of emissions can only be achieved
   when policies are supportive and well targeted, standards and incentives
   are realistic and flexible, and the public is actively responsive to
   environmental degradation. Turkey's high rate of energy-related carbon
   emissions growth is expected to accelerate, with emissions climbing from
   57 million tons in 2000 to almost 210 million tons in 2020. Carbon
   intensity in Turkey is higher than the western developed nation average.
   In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be one of the most

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{33-44}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Large scale integration of wind energy poses new challenges to the
   European power system due to its stochastic nature and often remote
   location. In this paper a multivariate uncertainty analysis problem is
   formulated for the integration of stochastic wind energy in the European
   grid. By applying Copula theory a synthetic set of data is generated
   from scarce wind speed reanalysis data in order to achieve the increased
   sample size for the subsequent Monte Carlo simulation.
   In the presented case study, European wind power samples are generated
   from the modeled stochastic process. Under the precondition of a modeled
   perfect market environment, wind power impacts dispatch decisions and
   therefore leads to alterations in power balances. Stochastic power
   balances are implemented in a detailed model of the European electricity
   network, based on the generated samples. Finally, a Monte Carlo method
   is used to determine power flows and contingencies in the system. An
   indicator is elaborated in order to analyze risk of overloading and to
   prioritize necessary grid reinforcements. Implications for the Swiss
   power grid are investigated in detail, revealing that the current system
   is significantly put at risk in certain areas by the further integration
   of wind power in Europe.
   It is the first time that the results of a probabilistic model for wind
   energy are further deployed within a power system analysis of the
   interconnected European grid. The method presented in this paper allows
   to account for stochastic wind energy in a load flow analysis and to
   evaluate deterministic indicators, such as the N - 1 criterion, on a
   probabilistic basis. Thus, it constitutes an important extension of
   deterministic models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: An epidemiological study was undertaken to identify
   determinant factors in the occurrence of American cutaneous
   leishmaniasis in areas under the influence of hydroelectric plants in
   Paranapanema river, State of Parana, Brazil. The ecological aspects of
   the phlebotomine fauna were investigated. Methods: Sandflies were
   sampled with automatic light traps from February 2004 to June 2006 at 25
   sites in the urban and rural areas of Itambaraca, and in Porto Almeida
   and Sao Joaquim do Pontal. Results: A total of 3,187 sandflies of 15
   species were captured. Nyssomyia neivai predominated (34.4\%), followed
   by Pintomyia pessoai (32.6\%), Migonemyia migonei (11.6\%), Nyssomyia
   whitmani (8.8\%), and Pintomyia fischeri (2.7\%), all implicated in the
   transmission of Leishmania. Males predominated for Ny. neivai, and
   females for the other vector species, with significant statistical
   differences (p < 0.001). Nyssomyia neivai, Pi. pessoai, Ny. whitmani,
   Brumptomyia brumpti, Mg. migonei, and Pi. fischeri presented the highest
   values for the Standardized Species Abundance Index (SSAI). The highest
   frequencies and diversities were found in the preserved forest in Porto
   Almeida, followed by forests with degradation in Sao Joaquim do Pontal
   and Vila Rural. Conclusions: Sandflies were captured in all localities,
   with the five vectors predominating. Ny. neivai had its highest
   frequencies in nearby peridomestic environments and Pi. pessoai in areas
   of preserved forests. The highest SSAI values of Ny. neivai and Pi.
   pessoai reflect their wider dispersion and higher frequencies compared
   with other species, which seems to indicate that these two species may
   be transmitting leishmaniasis in the area.}},

Abstract = {{Ice-clad transmission lines can seriously damage a power grid, causing a

   and practical topological structures of the dc de-icer have been
   proposed, and the prototypes have been developed and tested in the field
   successfully. Then, the defensive strategy of the power grid for ice
   disaster based on dc dicers is proposed. The application during the

   `Moderate SWH implementation' will provide 0.83 EJ of clean energy until
   2030 and estimated cost savings of 231 billion rand. For an `Accelerated
   SWH implementation these figures are 1.3 EJ and 369 billion rand. The
   estimated accumulated reduction of CO2 emissions due to SWH can be as

Abstract = {{At the end of 2010, China's contribution to global CO2 emissions reached
   25.1\%. Estimates show that power generation accounts for 37.2\% of the
   Chinese CO2 emissions. Even though there is an increasing number of
   studies using life cycle analysis (LCA) to examine energy consumption
   and CO2 emissions required by different types of power generation
   technologies, there are very few studies focusing on China. Furthermore,
   the nexus between water consumption and energy production has largely
   been ignored. In this paper, we adopt input-output based hybrid life
   cycle analysis to evaluate water consumption and CO2 emissions of wind
   power in China. Our results show that China's wind energy consumes 0.64
   l/kWh of water and produces 69.9 g/kWh of CO2 emission. Given that the
   Chinese government aims to increase the wind power generation capacity
   to 200 GW by 2020, wind power could contribute a 23\% reduction in
   carbon intensity and could save 800 million m(3) of water which could be
   sufficient enough for use by 11.2 million households. Thus, given the
   often postulated water crisis, China's energy policy would reap double
   benefits through progressive energy policies when increasing the share
   of wind power as part of overall efforts to diversify its electricity
   generation technologies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   examining the relationship between species richness and their

   equilibrium with contemporary climate to a greater degree than those of
   seed plants and most terrestrial vertebrates partly due to the lightness
   of their spores, which is highly capable of long-distance dispersal by

   correlation and regression analyses and structural equation modeling
   technique, we examine the relationship of pteridophyte species richness

   representing energy, water, and energy-water balance. We found that

Abstract = {{Synthetic ammonia production is an energy intensive industry in China

   4 policy scenarios were designed to project future water pollution

   ensemble mean. Comparisons are made against 28-years (1 October 1979-30
   September 2007) of United States Geological Survey observed streamflow
   for 961 small basins and 8 major basins over the conterminous United
   States (CONUS). Relative bias, anomaly correlation and Nash-Sutcliffe
   Efficiency (NSE) statistics at daily to annual time scales are used to
   assess model-simulated streamflow. The Noah (the Mosaic) model
   overestimates (underestimates) mean annual runoff and underestimates
   (overestimates) mean annual evapotranspiration. The SAC-SMA and VIC
   models simulate the mean annual runoff and evapotranspiration well when
   compared with the observations. The ensemble mean is closer to the mean
   annual observed streamflow for both the 961 small basins and the 8 major
   basins than is the mean from any individual model. All of the models, as
   well as the ensemble mean, have large daily, weekly, monthly, and annual
   streamflow anomaly correlations for most basins over the CONUS, implying
   strong simulation skill. However, the daily, weekly, and monthly NSE
   analysis results are not necessarily encouraging, in particular for
   daily streamflow. The Noah and Mosaic models are useful (NSE > 0.4) only
   for about 10\% of the 961 small basins, the SAC-SMA and VIC models are
   useful for about 30\% of the 961 small basins, and the ensemble mean is
   useful for about 42\% of the 961 small basins. As the time scale
   increases, the NSE increases as expected. However, even for monthly
   streamflow, the ensemble mean is useful for only 75\% of the 961 small
   basins.}},

Abstract = {{Results are presented from the second phase of the multiinstitution
   North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2) research
   partnership. In NLDAS, the Noah, Variable Infiltration Capacity,
   Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting, and Mosaic land surface models
   (LSMs) are executed over the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) in realtime and
   retrospective modes. These runs support the drought analysis, monitoring
   and forecasting activities of the National Integrated Drought
   Information System, as well as efforts to monitor large-scale floods.
   NLDAS-2 builds upon the framework of the first phase of NLDAS (NLDAS-1)
   by increasing the accuracy and consistency of the surface forcing data,
   upgrading the land surface model code and parameters, and extending the
   study from a 3-year (1997-1999) to a 30-year (1979-2008) time window. As
   the first of two parts, this paper details the configuration of NLDAS-2,
   describes the upgrades to the forcing, parameters, and code of the four
   LSMs, and explores overall model-to-model comparisons of land surface
   water and energy flux and state variables over the CONUS. Focusing on
   model output rather than on observations, this study seeks to highlight
   the similarities and differences between models, and to assess changes
   in output from that seen in NLDAS-1. The second part of the two-part
   article focuses on the validation of model-simulated streamflow and
   evaporation against observations. The results depict a higher level of
   agreement among the four models over much of the CONUS than was found in
   the first phase of NLDAS. This is due, in part, to recent improvements
   in the parameters, code, and forcing of the NLDAS-2 LSMs that were
   initiated following NLDAS-1. However, large inter-model differences
   still exist in the northeast, Lake Superior, and western mountainous
   regions of the CONUS, which are associated with cold season processes.
   In addition, variations in the representation of sub-surface hydrology
   in the four LSMs lead to large differences in modeled evaporation and
   subsurface runoff. These issues are important targets for future
   research by the land surface modeling community. Finally, improvement
   from NLDAS-1 to NLDAS-2 is summarized by comparing the streamflow
   measured from U. S. Geological Survey stream gauges with that simulated
   by four NLDAS models over 961 small basins.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{305-322}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Currently, hydropower accounts for close to 16\% of the world's total
   power supply and is the world's most dominant (86\%) source of renewable
   electrical energy. The key resource for hydropower generation is runoff,
   which is dependent on precipitation. The future global climate is
   uncertain and thus poses some risk for the hydropower generation sector.
   The crucial question and challenge then is what will be the impact of
   climate change on global hydropower generation and what are the
   resulting regional variations in hydropower generation potential? This
   paper is a study that aims to evaluate the changes in global hydropower
   generation resulting from predicted changes in climate. The study uses
   an ensemble of simulations of regional patterns of changes in runoff,
   computed from global circulation models (GCM) simulations with 12
   different models. Based on these runoff changes, hydropower generation
   is estimated by relating the runoff changes to hydropower generation
   potential through geographical information system (GIS), based on 2005
   hydropower generation. Hydropower data obtained from EIA (energy
   generation), national sites, FAO (water resources) and UNEP were used in
   the analysis. The countries/states were used as computational units to
   reduce the complexities of the analysis. The results indicate that there
   are large variations of changes (increases/decreases) in hydropower
   generation across regions and even within regions. Globally, hydropower
   generation is predicted to change very little by the year 2050 for the
   hydropower system in operation today. This change amounts to an increase
   of less than 1\% of the current (2005) generation level although it is
   necessary to carry out basin level detailed assessment for local impacts
   which may differ from the country based values. There are many regions
   where runoff and hydropower generation will increase due to increasing
   precipitation, but also many regions where there will be a decrease.
   Based on this evaluation, it has been concluded that even if individual
   countries and regions may experience significant impacts, climate change
   will not lead to significant changes in the global hydropower
   generation, at least for the existing hydropower system.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite and gridded meteorological data can be used to estimate
   evaporation (E) from land surfaces using simple diagnostic models. Two
   satellite datasets indicate a positive trend (first time derivative) in
   global available energy from 1983 to 2006, suggesting that positive
   trends in evaporation may occur in ``wet{''} regions where energy supply
   limits evaporation. However, decadal trends in evaporation estimated
   from water balances of 110 wet catchments ((E) over bar (wb)) do not
   match trends in evaporation estimated using three alternative methods:
   1) (E) over bar (MTE), a model-tree ensemble approach that uses
   statistical relationships between E measured across the global network
   of flux stations, meteorological drivers, and remotely sensed fraction
   of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation; 2) (E) over bar (Fu), a
   Budyko-style hydrometeorological model; and 3) (E) over bar (PML), the
   Penman-Monteith energy-balance equation coupled with a simple
   biophysical model for surface conductance. Key model inputs for the
   estimation of (E) over bar (Fu) and (E) over bar (PML) are remotely
   sensed radiation and gridded meteorological fields and it is concluded
   that these data are, as yet, not sufficiently accurate to explain trends
   in E for wet regions. This provides a significant challenge for
   satellite-based energy-balance methods. Trends in (E) over bar (wb) for
   87 ``dry{''} catchments are strongly correlated to trends in
   precipitation (R-2 = 0.85). These trends were best captured by (E) over
   bar (Fu), which explicitly includes precipitation and available energy
   as model inputs.}},

Title = {{Applying simple water-energy balance frameworks to predict the climate
   sensitivity of streamflow over the continental United States}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2531-2546}},
Abstract = {{The prediction of climate effects on terrestrial ecosystems and water
   resources is one of the major research questions in hydrology.
   Conceptual water-energy balance models can be used to gain a first order
   estimate of how long-term average streamflow is changing with a change
   in water and energy supply. A common framework for investigation of this
   question is based on the Budyko hypothesis, which links hydrological
   response to aridity. Recently, Renner et al. (2012) introduced the
   climate change impact hypothesis (CCUW), which is based on the
   assumption that the total efficiency of the catchment ecosystem to use
   the available water and energy for actual evapotranspiration remains
   constant even under climate changes.
   Here, we confront the climate sensitivity approaches (the Budyko
   approach of Roderick and Farquhar, 2011, and the CCUW) with data of more
   than 400 basins distributed over the continental United States. We first
   estimate the sensitivity of streamflow to changes in precipitation using
   long-term average data of the period 1949 to 2003. This provides a
   hydro-climatic status of the respective basins as well as their expected
   proportional effect to changes in climate. Next, we test the ability of
   both approaches to predict climate impacts on streamflow by splitting
   the data into two periods. We (i) analyse the long-term average changes
   in hydro-climatology and (ii) derive a statistical classification of
   potential climate and basin change impacts based on the significance of
   observed changes in runoff, precipitation and potential
   evapotranspiration. Then we (iii) use the different climate sensitivity
   methods to predict the change in streamflow given the observed changes
   in water and energy supply and (iv) evaluate the predictions by (v)
   using the statistical classification scheme and (vi) a conceptual
   approach to separate the impacts of changes in climate from basin
   characteristics change on streamflow. This allows us to evaluate the
   observed changes in streamflow as well as to assess the impact of basin
   changes on the validity of climate sensitivity approaches.
   The apparent increase of streamflow of the majority of basins in the US
   is dominated by an increase in precipitation. It is further evident that
   impacts of changes in basin characteristics appear simultaneously with
   climate changes. There are coherent spatial patterns with catchments
   where basin changes compensate for climatic changes being dominant in
   the western and central parts of the US. A hot spot of basin changes
   leading to excessive runoff is found within the US Midwest. The impact
   of basin changes on the prediction is large and can be twice as much as
   the observed change signal. Although the CCUW and the Budyko approach
   yield similar predictions for most basins, the data of water-limited
   basins support the Budyko framework rather than the CCUW approach, which
   is known to be invalid under limiting climatic conditions.}},

Title = {{China's water-energy nexus: greenhouse-gas emissions from groundwater
   use for agriculture}},

Abstract = {{China is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the
   agricultural sector in China is responsible for 17-20\% of annual
   emissions and 62\% of total freshwater use. Groundwater abstraction in
   China has increased rapidly from 10 km(3) yr(-1) in the 1950s to more
   than 100 km(3) yr(-1) in the 2000s, such that roughly 70\% of the
   irrigated area in northern China is now groundwater-fed. Pumping of
   water for irrigation is one of the most energy consuming on-farm
   processes; however, to date this source of GHG emissions in China and
   elsewhere has been relatively neglected. We derive the first detailed
   estimate of GHG emissions from groundwater pumping for irrigation in
   China, using extensive village survey data from 11 provinces, broadly
   representative of the situation during the mid-2000s. The 11 provinces
   cover roughly half of China's irrigated cropland and we upscale to the
   national level using government statistics for the remaining 20
   provinces. Our results show emissions of 33.1 MtCO(2)e, just over half a
   per cent of the national total. Groundwater abstraction represents an
   important source of GHG emissions that has been rapidly increasing and
   which at present is largely unregulated. Water scarcity in China is
   already driving policies to improve water conservation. These results
   suggest that significant potential exists to promote the co-benefits of
   water and energy saving in order to meet national planning targets.}},

Abstract = {{With projected increases in population and urbanisation in Australia,
   the sustainable supply of water and energy over the medium to long term
   will be an important challenge. In this context, meeting a part of the
   growing demand for urban water may involve reliance upon desalinated
   water in the future. Moreover, the feasibility and viability of
   renewable energy sources for water desalination will be of policy
   importance, particularly in a potentially low carbon Australian economy.
   In this article, we analyse the potential applicability of solar and
   wind energy to provide power for water desalination. In two illustrative
   examples, we assess the feasibility of supplying 3\% of Sydney's
   projected total water consumption (supplied at an average rate of 24.7
   Gl/yr) and 5\% of Sydney's projected water consumption (supplied at an
   average rate of 32.7 Gl/yr) over a 15-yr period (2011-2025) using a
   photovoltaic (PV) solar powered (130 MW) and a hybrid (PV solar and wind
   energy) powered (205 MW) reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants,
   respectively. In addition to supplying cleaner energy, the renewable
   energy sources considered in this article have additional cost
   advantages in the presence of a carbon penalty. For example, at
   hypothetical carbon penalty rates of \$20/tCO(2) and \$30/tCO(2), the
   estimated cost savings-in net present value (NPV) terms assuming a
   discount rate of 4.2\%-of the PV solar (hybrid) plant will amount to
   around be \$18.7m (\$25.2 m) and \$28.0m (\$37.9m), respectively, over
   the 15-yr period, relative to a situation where the desalination plant
   is instead being powered by black coal. Under a discount rate of 8.4\%,
   the cost savings of the PV solar (hybrid) plant associated with carbon
   penalty rates of \$20/tCO(2) and \$30/tCO(2) are estimated to be around
   \$12.8m (\$17.6 m) and \$19.2m (\$26.4m), respectively, in NPV terms.
   Our analysis also shows that in addition to providing the required power
   supply for the illustrative desalination plants, the renewable energy
   supply sources analysed here would produce excess electricity that could
   be sold to a nearby grid. Consequently, assuming a wholesale electricity
   price of \$36.74/MWh, the PV solar plant and the hybrid renewable plant
   are estimated to have the capacity to earn around \$63.9 million and
   \$110.0 million in NPV terms, respectively, over the 15-yr period,
   through excess electricity sales. Under a discount rate of 8.4\%, the
   value of the excess electricity sales of the PV solar plant and the
   hybrid renewable plant are estimated to be around \$54.5 million and
   \$91.7 million, respectively, in NPV terms. (C) 2012 American Institute

Abstract = {{A solar water heating system (SWHS) is a device that makes available the
   thermal energy of the incident solar radiation for use in various water
   heating applications. SWHS largely depends on the performance of the
   collector's efficiency at capturing the incident solar radiation and
   transferring it to the water. With today's SWHS, water can be heated up
   to temperatures of 60-80 degrees C. Heated water is collected in a tank
   insulated to prevent heat loss. Circulation of water from the tank
   through the collectors and back to the tank continues automatically due
   to the thermosiphon principle. The hot water generated finds many
   end-use applications in domestic, commercial, and industrial sectors.
   India has the highest energy intensities in Asia. Very little investment
   and priority are being given to increase of the efficiency. On the other
   hand, the India has a high potential for developing energy production
   from renewable energy sources (RES): solar, water, wind and biomass.
   However, these potentials are not studied and exploited enough and the
   present situation for their utilization is not so good. Although energy
   is a critical foundation for economic growth and social progress of any
   country, there are many constraints for RES development in all of them
   (political, technological, financial, legislative, educational, etc.).
   Obviously, defining development strategies and new support measures is
   necessary since renewable energy sources can make an important
   contribution to the regional energy supply and security. The main
   purpose of this paper is to explore the solar water heating system
   (opportunities) in India. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   is an important pioneer vegetation formation along the Xingu River in
   the area where the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam is being constructed
   that is highly adapted to a seasonally fluctuating water levels. The aim
   of this study was to examine the habitat and flora of the pioneer
   formations in the Belo Monte area. The area was divided in three
   sections for study purposes (Reservoir, Low Flow, and Control) that were
   expected to experience different degrees of impact from the dam project.
   The calculations of habitat losses were based on satellite imagery

   areas for vegetation sampling. Habitat losses of the pioneer formations
   will total 89.7\% when the project is fully functional. Forty-five of
   the 72 recorded species are restricted to single areas. Species richness
   and diversity were significantly lower in the control area. The
   completion of the Belo Monte reservoir will result in habitat reductions
   and will consequently reduce the richness and diversity of pioneer

Abstract = {{The effective use of agricultural input is only possible when spatial
   variability is recognized in the field by using information and
   precision farming technology then managed according to it. Effective and
   productive plant production requires the most appropriate water
   application strategies that take soil, climate, and farming operations
   into account. In addition to this, inputs used must be applied to where
   it is required without giving any harmful effects to the environment. In
   this study, spatial soil texture maps were created. Based on this soil
   maps, a total available water map was developed. According to the
   available water distribution map in the field, a variable rate water
   application map was produced in real farming data. Based on these
   variable rate water application maps, an economic evaluation was made to
   see the potential of energy and water savings. An estimation of the
   total water and energy saving in Adana, Cukurova has shown very
   promising results. According to evaluation of site specific irrigation
   for 38,8 ha maize field irrigation in Adana, Cukurova, 5.3\% water
   saving which is equal to 847 m(3) was possible for the 2009 irrigation
   season. It is also proved that using site specific irrigation technique
   offers a considerable energy saving with 587 to 1300 toe (tons of oil

Abstract = {{Feed production constitutes a major portion of the energy and water
   resource inputs in modern livestock production. Schemes to reduce these
   inputs may include local sourcing of animal feed. However, in water
   stressed regions where irrigation of feed crops is necessary, a
   trade-off between local sourcing (with high water stress) and transport
   from less water stressed regions can occur. We demonstrate this
   trade-off in the U.S. by combining state-level irrigation water use and
   pumping energy demand from USDA surveys with fertilizer and
   transportation energy demands for producing major feed crops (corn
   grain, soybean, alfalfa hay, corn silage) in each state and delivering
   them to two hypothetical dairy farms located in Kersey, CO and
   Rosendale, WI. A back-up technology approach is employed to express
   freshwater resource depletion in units of energy, allowing direct
   comparison with other energy resource demands. Corn grain, soybean, and
   alfalfa hay delivered to CO demonstrate a clear trade-off between
   transportation energy (proportional to the distance between CO and the
   production state) and water stress. On the other hand, transportation
   burdens dominate for corn silage, making local production most
   attractive, even in water stressed regions. All crops delivered to WI (a
   region of low water stress and minimal irrigation) are dominated by
   transportation burdens, making local production preferable, but this is
   clearly not a universal principal, as other cases show. This paper
   quantitatively elucidates the water-energy trade-off in sourcing feed
   for livestock and the method is expected to be applicable in managing
   supply chain logistics of other farm commodities.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although leishmaniases are regarded as serious public health
   issues in the State of Tocantins, as consequence of the impact of
   environmental changes, small advances in taxonomic and ecological
   studies of Phlebotominae fauna are taking place in this state. The
   present study aimed to improve the knowledge about the sand flies, as
   well as about the aspects of the bioecology of leishmaniases vectors
   from Porto Nacional, a city that was directly impacted by the
   construction of Luis Eduardo Magalhaes Hydroelectric Plant (HEP -
   Lajeado).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Sand flies were collected monthly using
   CDC light traps and Shannon traps for a period of 40 consecutive months,
   at different monitoring stations, where 7162 specimens were collected
   and 48 species were detected. Among the species found, 22 are first
   records in the state and seven are considered important vectors of
   leishmaniases. Lutzomyia longipalpis, the vector of American Visceral
   Leishmaniasis (AVL) showed higher frequency in urban compared to rural
   areas, and Nyssomyia whitmani, the vector of American Cutaneous
   Leishmaniasis (ACL), predominated in rural areas. The frequency and
   habits of sand fly vectors are discussed considering environmental
   characteristics and climatic factors.
   Conclusions/Significance: The construction of dams requires a great
   amount of labor, therefore attracting people from elsewhere. Increased
   migration, without adequate structure, leads to bad living conditions in
   new and unplanned settlements. It also leads to deforestation associated
   with environmental impacts, which can facilitate the spread of
   leishmaniases. This study discusses the importance of Lu. longipalpis
   and Ny. whitmani on the transmission cycles of leishmaniases in Porto
   Nacional and the record of Bi. flaviscutellata in periurban area of the

Abstract = {{We investigate the influence of non-differential components to the power
   system small signal stability region in this paper. A method named
   unified expression function (UEF) is introduced to describe the
   piecewise, continuous and non-differential function in the small signal
   stability study. It converts non-differential points of the original
   function to poles of the UEF's derivative function. Then the derivative
   at those poles can be approximated by UEF's left-hand or right-hand
   derivative limits according to the requirement. Based on this method,
   impact of the exciter voltage limit to power system small signal
   stability region is then deeply discussed using a simple three-bus power
   system. We find that the exciter voltage limit can change elements of
   the system Jacobian matrix so as to cause jump of the system critical
   eigenvalue. As a result, two new Hopf bifurcation boundaries and a new
   instability hole emerge in the small signal stability region. When the
   exciter voltage limit varies, the new instability hole and the new Hopf
   bifurcation boundaries will change significantly. It makes the
   topological characteristics of the small signal stability region much
   more complicated. Since there are many non-differential components in
   power systems, they should be correctly considered in power system
   stability studies. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   impact of the thickness of grout curtain, permeability of grout curtain,

   condition, water pressure is equal to hydrostatic one no matter grout
   curtain is selected or not, water pressure under drained condition is
   far less than that of un-drained condition, drainage in tunnel can
   reduce tunnel water pressure effectively. For same inflow, both
   increasing of thickness and decrease of hydraulic conductivity of grout
   curtain can reduce water pressure effectively. For the same water
   pressure, the smaller inflow of grout curtain, the less volume of water
   to be discharged. The impact of hydraulic conductivity of grout curtain
   is more obvious than that of thickness. With increasing of internal
   water pressure, the water pressure of grout curtain increases too, and
   the water pressure increases nearly linearly. The proposed thickness of
   grout curtain for the diversion tunnels is 16 m.}},

Abstract = {{Reanalyses, retrospectively analyzing observations over climatological
   time scales, represent a merger between satellite observations and
   models to provide globally continuous data and have improved over
   several generations. Balancing the earth's global water and energy
   budgets has been a focus of research for more than two decades. Models
   tend to their own climate while remotely sensed observations have had
   varying degrees of uncertainty. This study evaluates the latest NASA
   reanalysis, the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and
   Applications (MERRA), from a global water and energy cycles perspective,
   to place it in context of previous work and demonstrate the strengths
   and weaknesses.
   MERRA was configured to provide complete budgets in its output
   diagnostics, including the incremental analysis update (IAU), the term
   that represents the observations influence on the analyzed states,
   alongside the physical flux terms. Precipitation in reanalyses is
   typically sensitive to the observational analysis. For MERRA, the global
   mean precipitation bias and spatial variability are more comparable to
   merged satellite observations {[}the Global Precipitation and
   Climatology Project (GPCP) and Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis
   of Precipitation (CMAP)] than previous generations of reanalyses. MERRA
   ocean evaporation also has a much lower value, which is comparable to
   independently derived estimate datasets. The global energy budget shows
   that MERRA cloud effects may be generally weak, leading to excess
   shortwave radiation reaching the ocean surface.
   Evaluating the MERRA time series of budget terms, a significant change
   occurs that does not appear to be represented in observations. In 1999,
   the global analysis increments of water vapor changes sign from negative
   to positive and primarily lead to more oceanic precipitation. This
   change is coincident with the beginning of Advanced Microwave Sounding
   Unit (AMSU) radiance assimilation. Previous and current reanalyses all
   exhibit some sensitivity to perturbations in the observation record, and
   this remains a significant research topic for reanalysis development.
   The effect of the changing observing system is evaluated for MERRA water
   and energy budget terms.}},

Abstract = {{Savannas comprise a large proportion of the terrestrial land surface and
   are highly varied in their composition, structure and function. These
   characteristics alter land-atmosphere exchanges of heat, water, carbon
   dioxide and other trace gases, which feed back to the climate at
   multiple scales. Australian savannas provide significant ecosystem
   services and further systematic scientific study is needed to
   sustainably manage these ecosystems. We undertook an interdisciplinary
   research effort to understand the patterns and processes of carbon,
   water and energy cycles across northern Australian landscapes across
   scales from point to region. We quantified the land surface-atmosphere
   exchanges across the vast region of Australian savannas using a
   hierarchical, integrated measurement and modelling approach to determine
   regional greenhouse gas and water budgets. The research team comprised
   groups from seven institutions and four countries. The research effort
   comprised of a multi- year measurement and modelling endeavour and
   culminated in an intensive field program held in September 2008 (late
   dry season). The program aimed to improve our knowledge of the spatial
   and temporal variability of land-atmosphere exchanges and the processes
   driving them as well as our ability to remotely sense them and simulate
   them using land surface models, which are crucial components of Global
   Climate Models. We attempted to robustly integrate small scale
   processes, such as leaf photosynthesis to larger scales applicable to
   modelling and remote sensing for the savanna region. In this paper we
   provide the scientific background and our overall approach to the
   program with reference to the papers in this ``Savanna Patterns of
   Energy and Carbon Integrated Across the Landscape{''} (SPECIAL) issue.

Abstract = {{Due to the distinct seasonal characteristics of hydropower, this study
   tries to propose a seasonal decomposition (SD) based least squares
   support vector regression (LSSVR) ensemble learning model for Chinese

   decomposed into trend cycle, seasonal factor and irregular component.
   Then the LSSVR with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel is used to
   predict the three different components independently. Finally, these
   prediction results of the three components are combined with another
   LSSVR to formulate an ensemble result for the original hydropower
   consumption series. In terms of error measurements and statistic test on
   the forecasting performance, the proposed approach outperforms all the
   other benchmark methods listed in this study in both level accuracy and

Abstract = {{The mapping of the small hydropower (SHP) resource over a given
   territory is indispensable to identify suitable sites for the
   development of SHP renewable energy projects. In this study, a
   straightforward method to map the SUP potential over a large territory
   is presented. The methodology uses a synthetic hydro network (SHN)
   created from digital elevation models (DEM) to ensure precise hydro head
   estimations. From the SHN, hydro heads are calculated by subtracting the
   minimum from the maximum elevation of synthetic stream segments.
   Subsequently, stream segments with low hydro heads over a specified
   maximum distance are removed. Finally, the method uses regional
   regression models to estimate the annual baseflow for all drainage areas
   in the study area. The technical SHP potential can then be estimated as
   a function of the hydro head and maximum penstock length. An application
   of the method is made to the province of New Brunswick, Canada, where
   SHP maps have been developed to promote the development of the SUP
   energy sector in the province. In terms of the SHP opportunity, it is
   shown that the province of New Brunswick (71,450 km(2)) has a good SHP
   resource. Using a representative hydro head (10 m) and penstock length
   (3000 m) for the region, 696 potential sites have been identified over
   the territory. Results show that the technical SHP potential for New
   Brunswick is 368 MW for the conventional hydroelectric reservoir SUP
   configuration, while for the run-of-river SUP configuration, the
   technical SHP potential is 58 MW. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Cascade hydropower exploitation (CHE) has become an inevitable trend of
   global hydropower development in the future, and also China's basic
   policy on hydropower exploitation. Most of works so far focus on the
   accumulated effects caused by CHE, but the systematic assessment of the
   security scale of CHE as well as section management according to
   different rivers and different sections of one same river is seriously
   lacking. This article selectively analyses the process, section
   management linkage, section control scale of CHE based on existing
   literatures review and cases experiment in Southwestern China. Remarked
   conclusions include: (1) The river health is the central issue for
   sustainable exploitation of the river and integrated management of the
   river basin, instream flow requirements in different sections of the
   river should be met first: it is the key scientific basis for CHE to
   determine the maximum scale and reference standard of hydropower
   exploitation in each river section according to the minimum ecological
   flow. (2) Three management issues of CHE should be emphasized: to
   integrate special cascade hydropower planning with river section
   planning, under integrated planning of river basin; to regulate the
   existing management system for CHE; to balance stakeholder's interest
   and benefit in exploitation decision-making. (3) The security scale of
   CHE on different rivers and different sections atone same river should
   be measured by three reference scales, i.e., the critical scale of CHE
   based on the minimum ecological flow, the critical scale of CHE based on
   per unit river fall and per unit flow, and by combinations of the three
   reference scales. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Studying the popularization of solar water heaters (SWHs) is significant
   for understanding China's transition to green energy systems. Using
   Dezhou as a case study, this paper presents new angles on analyzing SWH
   deployment in China by addressing both the economic potential and the
   institutional dimensions at the local level. Using estimates from the
   demand-side of hot water for a typical three-person household in Dezhou,
   the paper evaluates the economic potential of a SWH in saving
   electricity and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Then, expanding the
   analysis beyond economics, we take an institutionalist approach to study
   the institutional factors that contribute to Dezhou's success in SWH
   adoptions. By examining the five main actors in Dezhou's energy regime,
   we find that Dezhou's SWH deployment is driven by an urge to develop
   businesses and the local economy, and its success results from at least
   five unique factors, including the development of SWH industrial
   clusters in Dezhou, big manufacturers' market leadership in SWH
   innovations, a tight private enterprise-local government relation,
   geographic location within the SWH industrial belt, and the adaptive
   attitude of Dezhou's households towards natural resource scarcity. (C)

Abstract = {{Using a case-study, inductive, narrative approach, this article explores

   Project in East Malaysia. Situated on the island of Borneo, Bakun Dam is
   a 204 m high concrete face, rock filled dam on the Balui River in the
   Upper Rajang Basin in the rainforests of Sarawak. Bakun Dam and its
   affiliated infrastructure could be the single largest and most expensive
   energy project ever undertaken in Southeast Asia. Based on data
   collected through site visits, original field research in Sarawak, and
   more than 80 research interviews, the article begins by teasing out the
   complex history and drivers behind the Bakun project before identifying
   a set of potential social, political, and economic benefits the project
   could deliver. It then delves into six sets of barriers in the
   technical, economic, political, legal and regulatory, social, and
   environmental realms. We find that Bakun illustrates how centralized

   economies of scale and the ability to bring about transformational

Abstract = {{Risks associated with the left banks lope of Jinping first hydro power
   station in south western China are growing as a result of excavation of
   the dam foundation ditch and various tunnels, as well as grouting to
   soft strata. To improve our understanding of the slope instability and
   resolve the complex subsurface conditions of the highly fractured rock
   mass, a microseismic monitoring system was installed in June 2009, which
   is the first time such a technique has been introduced in to stability
   analysis of a high steep rock slope in China. The micro seismic
   monitoring system consists of a data acquisition unit, a data processing
   unit and a three-dimensional array of uniaxial accelerometers. In order
   to analyze the correlation between seismicity and potential slip surface
   of the slope, a numerical model was implemented to analyze the failure
   processes and stability of the slope. The monitoring results illustrate
   that microseismic events mainly occur as a strip along the spandrel
   groove of the dam, which coincides with the potential slipsurface
   obtained from numerical analysis, especially at the bottom of the slope.
   Therefore, the comprehensive method incorporating microseismic
   monitoring and numerical analysis has been proven to be very promising
   in instability prediction of rock slope subject to identification and

Abstract = {{Extracting, delivering, and disposing water requires energy, and
   similarly, many processes for extracting and refining various fuel
   sources and producing electricity use water. This so-called
   `water-energy nexus', is important to understand due to increasing
   energy demands and decreasing freshwater supplies in many areas. This
   paper performs a country-level quantitative assessment of this nexus in
   the MENA region. The results show a highly skewed coupling with a
   relatively weak dependence of energy systems on fresh water, but a
   strong dependence of water abstraction and production systems on energy.
   In case of Saudi Arabia it is estimated that up to 9\% of the total
   annual electrical energy consumption may be attributed to ground water
   pumping and desalination. Other countries in the Arabian Gulf may be
   consuming 5-12\% or more of total electricity consumption for
   desalination. The results suggest that policy makers should explicitly
   consider energy implications in water intensive food imports and future
   restructuring of water demand. This will help in making more integrated
   decisions on water and energy infrastructure systems. An integrated
   assessment may in some cases favor water reuse and changes in the

Abstract = {{With less than 6 mm of rain from November through February every year,
   the central regions of Nigeria are in acute need of safe and consistent
   water supplies for drinking and other domestic or agricultural uses.
   Borehole supplies are capable of meeting a significant proportion of

   heavy burden to already disadvantaged communities. In this study, a
   techno-economic analysis is carried out in order to assess the
   feasibility of renewable energy sources and technologies to substitute
   for fossil-fuel powered pumping platforms. The results indicate that
   there is sufficient solar resource throughout these regions to
   facilitate relatively cost effective water pumping solutions, as well as
   a potentially effective wind resource depending on the exact location of
   the pumping station. Although systems based on these resources have high
   capital costs compared to petrol or diesel-based platforms, over a
   20-year project life, the analysis indicates that ongoing fuel costs for
   a fossil-fuel-based system greatly outweigh the increased up-front costs
   of renewable alternatives. In conclusion, the results indicate that if
   the water demand at a particular site exceeds the capabilities of a hand
   pump, a renewable energy-powered pumping system is an attractive option,
   both economically and logistically in comparison to fossil-fuel-powered

Abstract = {{Hydroelectric reservoirs can release significant quantities of CO2, but
   very few results are available from the tropics. The objective of the
   present study was to estimate the emission of CO2 from the Balbina
   hydroelectric reservoir in the central Brazilian Amazon. Diffusive and
   ebullitive emissions were estimated at regular intervals, both above and
   below the dam, using a combination of static chambers and submerged
   funnels. Gas releases immediately below the dam were calculated as the
   difference between gas flux at the entrance and the outflow of the
   hydroelectric turbines. An inundation model derived from a bathymetric
   map and daily stage readings was used for spatial and temporal
   interpolation of reservoir emissions. Annual emissions of CO2, upstream
   and downstream of Balbina dam for 2005, were estimated as 2450 and 81 Gg
   C, respectively, for a total annual flux of 2531 Gg C. Upstream
   emissions were predominantly diffusive with only 0.02 Gg C yr(-1)
   resulting from ebullition. On average, 51\% of the downstream emission
   was released by degassing at the turbine outflow, and the remainder was
   lost by diffusion from the downstream river. The total annual greenhouse
   gas emission from Balbina dam, including the CO2 equivalent of
   previously estimated CH4 emissions, was 3 Tg C yr(-1), equivalent to
   approximately 50\% of the CO2 emissions derived from the burning of
   fossil fuels in the Brazilian metropolis of Sao Paulo.}},

Abstract = {{Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from reservoirs have been under the
   microscope for more a decade now. In particular, the high CH4 emissions
   reported in warm systems have tarnished the green credentials of
   hydroelectricity in terms of GHG emissions. Reliable estimates of CH4
   emissions are crucial, since CH4 has a greenhouse warming potential of
   25 and because, unlike CO2, CH4 emissions should be counted for the
   entire life cycle of a reservoir. Up to now, the highest CH4 emissions
   from reservoirs have been measured in warm latitudes, thus adding an
   argument against the use of hydroelectricity in these regions. However,
   to our knowledge, GHG emissions have been measured for only 18 of the
   741 large dams ( > 10 MW, according to the ICOLD register) listed in the
   tropics. This article reviews the limited scientific information
   available and concludes that, at this time, no global position can be
   taken regarding the importance and extent of GHG emissions in warm

   strategies due to cascading failures}},
Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{807-812}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Power systems are the basic support of modern infrastructures and
   protecting them from random failures or intentional attacks is an active
   topic of research in safety science. This paper is motivated by the
   following two related problems about cascading failures on power grids:
   efficient edge attack strategies and lower cost protections on edges.
   Applying the recent cascading model by adopting a local load
   redistribution rule, where the initial load of an edge ij is (k(i)k(j))
   with k(i) and k(j) being the degrees of the nodes connected by the edge,
   we investigate the performance of the power grid of the western United
   States subject to three intentional attacks. Simulation results show
   that the effects of different attacks for the network robustness against
   cascading failures have close relations with the tunable parameter 0.
   Particularly, the attack on the edges with the lower load in the case of
   0 < 1.4 can result in larger cascading failures than the one on the
   edges with the higher load. In addition, compared with the other two
   attacks, a new attack, i.e., removing the edges with the smallest
   proportion between the total capacities of the neighboring edges of and
   the capacity of the attacked edge, usually are prone to trigger
   cascading failures over the US power grid. Our findings will be not only
   helpful to protect the key edges selected effectively to avoid
   cascading-failure-induced disasters, but also useful in the design of
   high-robustness and low-cost infrastructure networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   datasets and four model products from the Global Land-surface Data
   Assimilation System. Surface evaporation and runoff climatologies are
   satisfactorily simulated, including surface energy and water partitions
   in dry and wet climates. In the Australian continent dominated by dry
   climate, slowly varying soil moisture processes are simulated in the
   southeast during austral winter. The model is skilful in reproducing the
   nonlinear relationship between rainfall and runoff variations in the
   southwestern part of the Australia. It shows that the significant
   downward trend of river inflow in the region is associated with enhanced
   surface evaporation which is caused by increased surface radiation and
   wind speed. In its carbon-cycle modeling, the model simulates an upward
   trend of NPP by about 0.69\%/year over the Amazonia forest region in the
   47-year period. By comparing two sets of the model results with/without

Abstract = {{The South African government has publicized plans to install one million
   solar water heaters in households throughout South Africa by the year
   2014, with the goals of reducing strain on existing electricity
   resources, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, creating employment and
   alleviating poverty. This paper examines two existing solar water heater
   installation projects with the aim of investigating the social
   contribution of the installation of solar water heaters in low-income
   households in South Africa. The Sustainable Urban Livelihoods approach
   (SULA) was adjusted to provide an analytical framework for the
   development of suitable indicators of social change in the context of
   renewable energies and energy poverty. Increases in household capital
   and the reduction of household vulnerability to shocks, stressors and
   seasonal variability as the result of solar water heater installation
   were investigated in projects in low-income housing developments in the
   cities of Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, South Africa.
   Data collected from paired household surveys (before and after
   installation) in over 600 households and qualitative information (Most
   Significant Change stories) show that the provision of a constant, cheap
   source of heated water contributed positively to the alleviation of
   energy poverty. Household capitals (categorised as Human, Social,
   Financial, Physical, Natural and Gender capital), including aspects such
   as health benefits and time and financial savings, were all positively
   effected by the installation of solar water heaters. In addition,
   improved energy security greatly reduced household vulnerability to
   shocks, stressors and seasonal variability. Comparison between the two
   projects revealed that the geographical setting (climatic conditions in
   particular), and the approach and strategies adopted by the implementers
   of the solar water heater installation project, greatly determine the
   extent to which benefits to the households are realised.}},

Abstract = {{Methane emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs can comprise a
   considerable portion of anthropogenic methane. However, lack of data on
   CH4 emissions in different geographical regions and high
   spatial-temporal variability in the emission rates of reservoirs has led
   to uncertainties regarding regional emission estimates of CH4. In the
   subtropical plateau climate region, we used the Ertan hydroelectric
   reservoir as a study area. The CH4 flux at the air-water interface was
   assessed by floating chambers and factors influencing emissions,
   including the distance from the dam, water depth, seasonal variation in
   wet and dry season, air-water temperature gradient and wind speed, and
   was also studied through a year-long systematic sampling and monitoring
   experiment. The results showed that the surface of the reservoir was a
   source of CH4 during the sampling period and the annual average CH4 flux
   was 2.80 +/- 1.52 mg m(-2) d(-1). CH4 flux (and its variation) was
   higher in the shallow water areas than in the deep-water areas. CH4 flux
   near the dam was significantly higher than that of other locations
   farther from the dam in the dry season. The seasonal variations of CH4
   emission in wet and dry seasons were minor and significant diurnal
   variations were observed in wet and dry seasons. Exponential
   relationships between the CH4 flux and air-water temperature gradient
   were found. Air-water temperature gradient was an important factor
   influencing diurnal variations of CH4 flux in the Ertan hydroelectric
   reservoir. These results indicate that systematic sampling is needed to
   better estimate CH4 flux through coverage of the spatial variation of
   different water depths, measuring-point distance from the dam, seasonal
   variation in wet and dry seasons and changes in climate factors (such as
   air-water temperature gradient). Our results also provide a fundamental
   parameter for CH4 emission estimation of global reservoirs. Copyright

Abstract = {{Land-surface and vegetation models divide the globe into discrete
   vegetation classes or plant functional types (PFTs). The current study
   quantifies some of the limitations of this simplification on global
   predictions of carbon, water, and energy fluxes. First, a
   state-of-the-art land-surface model, JULES-SF, is optimized against a
   diversity of calibration data sets (eddy covariance fluxes, field
   measurements of net primary production (NPP), and remotely sensed
   surface albedo) in order to retrieve a range of values for four key
   plant parameters within each PFT. This is done for 112 sites and 1200 1
   degrees land points. Second, global simulations are compared in which
   the parameter values per PFT are either fixed (standard method) or vary
   according to either the retrieved parameter range or the
   satellite-observed range (new methods). Retrieved key plant parameters
   exhibit a broad range, and the range overlap between PFTs is
   significant. The impact on the global simulation depends on the surface
   flux/state in question. Thus, the difference between the new and old
   method is small for albedo, net shortwave radiation, and continental
   runoff (0.005, 0.7\%, and 2\%, respectively) compared to current
   model-observation differences (0.05, 7\%, and 20\%, respectively). In
   contrast, carbon fluxes are more sensitive to the categorization of
   plant properties, with predicted global NPP varying by <= 15\% (6.2 Gt
   yr(-1)) according to whether the standard or one of the new methods is
   implemented.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Environmental variables, such as ambient energy, water availability, and
   environmental heterogeneity have been frequently proposed to account for
   species diversity gradients. How taxon-specific functional traits define
   large-scale richness gradients is a fundamental issue in understanding
   spatial patterns of species diversity, but has not been well documented.
   Using a large dataset on the regional flora from China, we examine the
   contrast spatial patterns and environmental determinants between
   pteridophytes and seed plants which differ in dispersal capacity and
   environmental requirements. Pteridophyte richness shows more pronounced
   spatial variation and stronger environmental associations than seed
   plant richness. Water availability generally accounts for more spatial
   variance in species richness of pteridophytes and seed plants than
   energy and heterogeneity do, especially for pteridophytes which have
   high dependence on moist and shady environments. Thus, pteridophyte
   richness is disproportionally affected by water-related variables; this
   in turn results in a higher proportion of pteridophytes in regional
   vascular plant floras (pteridophyte proportion) in wet regions. Most of
   the variance in seed plant richness, pteridophyte richness, and
   pteridophyte proportion explained by energy is included in variation
   that water and heterogeneity account for, indicating the redundancy of
   energy in the study extent. However, heterogeneity is more important for
   determining seed plant distributions. Pteridophyte and seed plant
   richness is strongly correlated, even after the environmental effects
   have been removed, implying functional linkages between them. Our study
   highlights the importance of incorporating biological traits of
   different taxonomic groups into the studies of macroecology and global
   change biology.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change, pollution, and energy insecurity are among the greatest
   problems of our time. Addressing them requires major changes in our
   energy infrastructure. Here, we analyze the feasibility of providing
   worldwide energy for all purposes (electric power, transportation,
   heating/cooling, etc.) from wind, water, and sunlight (WWS). In Part I,
   we discuss WWS energy system characteristics, current and future energy
   demand, availability of WWS resources, numbers of WWS devices, and area
   and material requirements. In Part II, we address variability,
   economics, and policy of WWS energy. We estimate that similar to
   3,800,000 5 MW wind turbines, similar to 49,000 300 MW concentrated
   solar plants, similar to 40,000 300 MW solar PV power plants, similar to
   1.7 billion 3 kW rooftop PV systems, similar to 5350 100 MW geothermal
   power plants, similar to 270 new 1300 MW hydroelectric power plants,
   similar to 720,000 0.75 MW wave devices, and similar to 490,000 1 MW
   tidal turbines can power a 2030 WWS world that uses electricity and
   electrolytic hydrogen for all purposes. Such a WWS infrastructure
   reduces world power demand by 30\% and requires only similar to 0.41\%
   and similar to 0.59\% more of the world's land for footprint and
   spacing, respectively. We suggest producing all new energy with WWS by
   2030 and replacing the pre-existing energy by 2050. Barriers to the plan
   are primarily social and political, not technological or economic. The
   energy cost in a WWS world should be similar to that today. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This is Part II of two papers evaluating the feasibility of providing
   all energy for all purposes (electric power, transportation, and
   heating/cooling), everywhere in the world, from wind, water, and the sun
   (WWS). In Part I, we described the prominent renewable energy plans that
   have been proposed and discussed the characteristics of WWS energy
   systems, the global demand for and availability of WWS energy,
   quantities and areas required for WWS infrastructure, and supplies of
   critical materials. Here, we discuss methods of addressing the
   variability of WWS energy to ensure that power supply reliably matches
   demand (including interconnecting geographically dispersed resources,
   using hydroelectricity, using demand-response management, storing
   electric power on site, over-sizing peak generation capacity and
   producing hydrogen with the excess, storing electric power in vehicle
   batteries, and forecasting weather to project energy supplies), the
   economics of WWS generation and transmission, the economics of WWS use
   in transportation, and policy measures needed to enhance the viability
   of a WWS system. We find that the cost of energy in a 100\% WWS will be
   similar to the cost today. We conclude that barriers to a 100\%
   conversion to WWS power worldwide are primarily social and political,

Abstract = {{Power grids are prone to failure. Time series of reliability measures
   such as total power loss or energy not supplied can give significant
   account of the underlying dynamical behavior of these systems, specially

   self-organization and the existence of critical points. In this paper, 7
   years (from 2002 to 2008) of Europe's transport of electricity network
   failure events have been analyzed and the best fit for this empirical
   data probability distribution is presented. With the actual span of
   available data and although there exists a moderate support for the
   power-law model, the relatively small amount of events contained in the
   function's tail suggests that causal factors other than

Abstract = {{With the objectives of climate change mitigation and energy

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to establish the most selective size of the
   gill net used to catch mapara, Hypophthalmus marginatus (Valenciennes,
   1840). The study was developed in the reservoir of UHE-Tucurui, by using
   experimental fisheries every three months from January 2001 to June
   2006. It was used gill net with 50 meters in length and 3 meters high
   with mesh sizes from 40 to 200mm. All fishes caught were identified,
   measured and weighted. The selectivity curves were estimated by
   determination of the selection factor, sample variation and optimum
   animal size. The fishes mapara were caught in gill net with mesh size
   from 20 to 140 mm (1,424 fishes). The mesh size of 80 mm was responsible
   for the higher proportion of catch (45.4\%). Once confirmed the linear
   relation between Ln(C(b)/C(a)) and the class center (L) for gillnet
   pairs studied were estimated the selectivity curves. According to these
   curves, the 80 mm mesh gillnet present an optimum length of catch equal
   to 422.13 mm, what represent a length above the length of the first
   reproductive cycle (410.00 mm). The amplitude of selection goes from
   265.27 to 578.99 mm, indicating that approximately 50\% of fishes caught
   are adult. It is suggested, therefore, the use of ``gill nets{''} with
   mesh sizes equal or than 80 mm between opposite knots, to assist in the
   drafting of specific legislation, besides tracking of the selectivity
   and the average length of capture.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of agrobiomasses, as a source of energy, to the
   reduction of greenhouse gas emissions was confirmed by several studies.
   Biomass from agriculture represents one of the larger and more diverse
   sources to exploit and in particular ethanol and diesel have the
   potential to be a sustainable replacement for fossil fuels, mainly for
   transport purposes. However, the cultivation of energy crops dedicated
   to the production of biofuels presents some potential problems, e. g.,
   competitiveness with food crops, water needs, use of fertilizers, etc.,
   and the economic, energy, and environmental convenience of such activity
   depends on accurate evaluations about the global efficiency of the
   production system. In this study, the processes related to the
   cultivation of energy crops were analyzed from an energy and water cost
   perspective. The crops studied, maize (Zea mais) and sunflower
   (Helianthus annuus), were identified for their different water
   requirements and cultivation management, which in turns induces
   different energy costs. A 50-year climatic series of meteorological data
   from 19 weather stations scattered in the Tuscany region was used to
   feed the crop model CropSyst for the simulation of crop production,
   water requirement, and cultivation techniques. Obtained results were
   analyzed to define the real costs of energy crop cultivation, depending
   on energy and water balances. In the energy crop cultivation, the only
   positive energy balance was obtained with the more efficient system of
   irrigation whereas all the other cases provided negative balances.
   Concerning water, the results demonstrated that more than 1.000 liters
   of water are required for producing 1 liter of bioethanol. As a
   consequence, the cultivation of energy crops in the reserved areas of
   the region will almost double the actual water requirement of the
   agricultural sector in Tuscany.}},

Abstract = {{Forecasts of 10-day average inflow into the Ertan hydropower station of

   Medium-range inflow forecasts have usually been obtained by
   Auto-Regressive-Moving-Average (ARMA) models, which do not utilize any
   precipitation forecasts. This paper presents a simple GFS-QPFs-based
   rainfall-runoff model (GRR) using the 10-day accumulated Quantitative
   Precipitation Forecasts from the Global Forecast System (GFS-QPFs) run
   at the American National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
   In this study, 10-day accumulated GFS-QPFs over the Yalong river basin
   are verified by first using a three-category contingency table. Then
   this paper presents the results from a proposed hydrological model using
   10-day accumulated GFS-QPFs. Results show that inflow forecast errors
   can be reduced considerably, compared with those from the currently used
   ARMA model by both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Finally,
   simulations of medium-range hydropower operation are also presented
   using the historical data and forecasts of 10-day average inflows into
   the Ertan dam during May to September 2006 to evaluate the efficiency of
   the proposed hydrological model using the GFS-QPFs. The simulations
   demonstrate that the use of GFS-QPFs has improved reservoir inflow

   electrical showers are present in over 90\% of residential buildings.
   For the residential consumer, while these high-power heating devices are
   the least-cost investment alternative, they lead to high running energy
   costs. Furthermore, due to their very low load factor (typically below
   2\%), each of these high-power showerheads results in considerably low
   return on the high investment costs in terms of infrastructure for the
   electricity sector. Particularly in low-income dwellings, electrical
   showerheads represent by far the highest electrical loads, resulting in
   a considerable component in the monthly energy bill. On the other hand,
   Brazil is one of the sunniest countries in the world, and solar water
   heating technologies have demonstrated large financial benefits and
   short payback times. Due to their comparatively higher initial
   investment costs, however, domestic solar water heaters are used mostly
   in higher income residences. In this work we present the potential of a
   low-cost version of the typical domestic solar water heating system for
   low-income dwellings, where the electrical resistance, which is normally
   installed inside the hot water tank, is replaced by a variable power
   electrical showerhead. This design avoids the use of electrical power as
   auxiliary heating for the whole of the boiler volume, since only the
   water which passes through the showerhead might be heated by the
   electrical resistance. This system configuration is a commercially
   available low-cost solar water, heater option. A case-study is presented
   for a statistically representative group of low-income dwellings with
   solar water heating systems in Florianopolis - Brazil. Our results show
   that the economies obtained are considerable, both in terms of energy
   consumption (kW h) and peak demand (kW) reduction. When compared with
   higher income typical users of solar water heating technologies, these
   economies represent a relatively higher benefit, both for the low-income
   population, as well as for the utilities involved. Our results also show
   that the avoided power costs, a benefit for the distribution utility
   company, might be more substantial than the avoided energy costs, a
   benefit for the end user. In the energy constrained on-peak hours
   period, the utility company might benefit from being able to sell this
   energy to other higher paying tariff consumers. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the energy and carbon footprints and land, water,
   and labor requirements of biodiesel production from canola in Western
   Australia (WA). The results show that canola-based biodiesel leads to
   limited energy profit and CO, equivalent (CO2-e) emissions savings. Even
   when all byproduct are utilized, a relatively low output/input energy
   ratio of 1.72 and a CO2-e emissions savings of only 0.52 kg of CO2-e/L
   of biodiesel are obtained under the WA conditions considered in this
   study. A land requirement of 1.66 x 10(-3) ha/L of biodiesel means that
   canola-based biodiesel seems to also be limited to <2\% replacement of
   total diesel consumption in WA's transport sector to avoid significant
   competition with food production for arable land. When some of the
   biodiesel is invested back into the production process to make the
   process independent of nonrenewable fuels, the competition for arable
   land use is even more severe, rendering it unfeasible to replace diesel
   fuel by the net biodiesel. Also, there would not be enough net biodiesel
   to support the transport activities that are usually supported by diesel
   fuel in the WA transport sector, and no CO2-e emissions savings would be
   achieved from replacing diesel fuel by net biodiesel. Overall,
   canola-based biodiesel is not sustainable to replace a significant
   fraction of diesel consumption in the WA transport sector. It can only
   play a limited role by offering some energy and CO2-e emissions savings
   and by providing immediate opportunities for introducing new transport
   fuels in the marketplace and developing familiarity among the consumers
   in our transition to a future sustainable biofuel supply.}},

Abstract = {{At present, China's economic development faces energy challenge, and the
   appropriate solution of energy bottleneck is the key to healthy, rapid
   and sustainable development. China's gross amount of hydraulic resource
   ranks first in the world; however, because of low level of development,
   hydraulic resource has a broad development prospect. Now, China's
   hydropower development is in its peak period. By the end of 2004, the
   gross installed hydropower capacity of China broke through 100 million
   kW. From there, it has remained in the top slot worldwide. The vigorous
   development of hydropower is necessary because of the energy shortage
   and environmental pollution in China in order to attain sustainable
   development of China's economy. Abundant hydraulic resource, huge market
   demands, the strategy of western development and the favorable
   environment of economic development provide hydropower construction with
   unprecedented advantages and opportunities. Chins hydropower development
   aims at an installed hydropower capacity of up to 194 million kW by
   2010, accounting for 23.1\% of the gross installed power capacity and
   35\% of hydropower resource. Finally, we present the general condition

Abstract = {{The study we present here analyzes the status of the water chiller
   energy efficiency standard in China. The national standard,
   GB19577-2004, which sets the grade and scale of water chiller energy
   efficiency, has been implemented for five years and has produced
   achievements in energy-saving and emission reduction, which is a basic
   state policy in China. This paper presents extensive investigations on
   water chiller energy efficiency conducted in 2009 and compares these
   results with results from 2003. This analysis shows that the average
   energy efficiency level in 2009 was higher than in 2003. Moreover, large
   units with more than a 5000 kW cooling capacity have now appeared, and
   low efficiency units with EERs (energy efficiency ratios) below 3.8 have
   been phased out. The standard should be upgraded every five years.
   Therefore, this paper proposes a draft of a new energy efficiency
   standard. In the draft, thermodynamic perfectibility eta is presented to
   be used as an indicator instead of the EER; for eta, 0.4 is the minimum
   allowable value and 0.6 is the maximum value. There is one category of
   cooling capacities, from 100 to 2000 kW, in which the energy efficiency
   has a linear relationship with its cooling capacity. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study examines the relative impact of regional land-cover/land-use

   Historic, present and projected future land cover data were used to
   drive the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model using observed
   meteorological forcing data for 1983-2007 over Wisconsin (USA). The
   current and projected future (year 2030) land cover data were developed
   using the land transformation model (LTM). The VIC model simulations
   were driven using downscaled and bias-corrected projected future climate
   forcing from three different Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change
   (IPCC) AR4 general circulation models (GCMs): HadCM3, PCM and GFDL.
   Sensitivity results conducted on a single grid cell show that annual
   average surface runoff and baseflow were increased by 8 and 6 mm,
   respectively, while evapotranspiration was reduced by 15 mm when a fully
   forested grid was converted to cropland. Results also indicate that
   annual average net radiation and sensible heat flux were reduced
   considerably due to forest-to-cropland conversion, and the reduction was
   more prominent in winter and spring seasons due to effect of snow
   albedo. Forest-to-cropland conversion also resulted in increased latent
   heat flux in summer (JJA) while this land transformation increased the
   snow water equivalent in winter (DJF) and spring (MAM). Complete
   conversion of forest to cropland resulted in a decrease of the radiative
   surface temperature on an annual basis with more cooling occurring in
   winter and summer. Impacts of historic deforestation were similar to
   what was expected based on a single grid sensitivity analysis. Copyright

Abstract = {{This study investigates consequences of integrating plug-in hybrid
   electric vehicles (PHEVs) in a wind-thermal power system supplied by one
   quarter of wind power and three quarters of thermal generation. Four
   different PHEV integration strategies, with different impacts on the
   total electric load profile, have been investigated. The study shows
   that PHEVs can reduce the CO2-emissions from the power system if
   actively integrated, whereas a passive approach to PHEV integration
   (i.e. letting people charge the car at will) is likely to result in an
   increase in emissions compared to a power system without PHEV load. The
   reduction in emissions under active PHEV integration strategies is due
   to a reduction in emissions related to thermal plant start-ups and part
   load operation. Emissions of the power sector are reduced with up to
   4.7\% compared to a system without PHEVs, according to the simulations.
   Allocating this emission reduction to the PHEV electricity consumption
   only, and assuming that the vehicles in electric mode is about 3 times
   as energy efficient as standard gasoline operation, total emissions from
   PHEVs would be less than half the emissions of a standard car, when

   gauging stations against daily streamflow records for the period of
   1985-95, and successfully evaluated for the period of 1996-2005.
   Single-grid sensitivity experiments showed that runoff, baseflow, and

   were also conducted to analyze the spatial and temporal variability of
   inundation area for the period of 1985-2005. Results indicated that

   large theoretical potentials while small for the river with small

Abstract = {{Because of declining public investments in irrigation projects in India,
   the growth of irrigated agricultural production has increasingly become
   reliant on unsustainable allocation of groundwater. As a result,
   groundwater resources are increasingly depleted and their role in
   buffering climate variability is lost. Given future climate and food
   supply uncertainty under mounting population pressure, it is vital that
   the connections between climate variability, unsustainable irrigation
   practices, and their impacts on regional-scale agricultural production
   are quantified.
   Here, the focus is on rice and maize production in the semiarid
   Telangana region in Andhra Pradesh, where the advent of inexpensive pump
   technology in the late twentieth century, coupled with governmentally
   subsidized electricity, has allowed year-round planting of
   water-intensive crops. Using a 35-yr climate and agricultural dataset
   from Telangana, nonlinear Gaussian process district-level regression
   models are developed to model dry-season irrigated area, which is a
   proxy for total groundwater use, in the function of climate-related
   predictors. The resulting models are able to accurately reproduce
   dry-season cropped area in most districts. Interannual climate
   variations play a significant role in determining groundwater use for
   irrigation. Nonlinear interactions between selected climate features are
   likely to influence irrigation water use significantly. These results
   suggest that the authors' modeling approach, combined with monsoon
   predictions, allow the forecasting of cropped area and agricultural
   water requirements at seasonal time scales within the bounds of
   uncertainty. The usefulness of such data to decision makers and
   stakeholders is discussed, as they attempt to use scarce surface and
   subsurface water resources more efficiently and sustainably.}},

Abstract = {{The Jinping I Hydropower Station will generate some 3,600 MW. The site

   geo-stresses in the marble bedrock are up to 40 MPa. Relaxation due to
   river incision has resulted in fractures opening up to 350 m from the
   rock face. The geo-stresses in the rock mass are significantly affected
   by the topography. A concentration of stress has developed at the foot
   of the slope and in the valley floor; it was estimated there would be
   132 mm of relaxation/heave of the formation level. The paper discusses

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the hybrid solar and hydro (SHE) system as a unique
   technological concept of the sustainable energy system that can provide
   continuous electric power and energy supply to its consumers and the
   possibilities of its implementation in Europe and areas with similar
   climate. The sustainability of such system is based on solar
   photovoltaic (PV) and hydroelectric (HE) energy as renewable energy
   sources (RES). For the purpose of connecting all relevant values into
   one integral SHE system, a mathematical model was developed for
   selecting the optimal size of the PV power plant as the key element for
   estimating the technological feasibility of the overall solution.
   Sensitivity analysis (parameter analysis) was made for the model, where
   local climate parameters were varied: solar radiation, air temperature,
   reservoir volume, total head, precipitation, evaporation and natural
   water inflow. It has been established that, apart from total head (which
   is to be expected), solar radiation, hydro accumulation size and natural
   water inflow have the biggest effect on the calculated power of the PV
   power plant. The obtained results clearly show a wide range of
   implementation of the new energy source (SHE system), i.e. from
   relatively cold climates to those abundant in solar energy, but also
   with relatively small quantity of water, because it only recirculates
   within the system. All this points to the necessity for further
   development of hybrid systems (RES + HE systems) and to the fact that
   they could play an important role in achieving climate objectives. (C)

Pages = {{45-56}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{On 28 October 1996, a landslide occurred on the Huashiban slope near the
   Liangjiaren Hydropower Station. The landslide was caused by a failure
   mechanism induced by an earthquake (Mw 7.0) at Lijiang on 3 February
   1996, after which a tensile fracture zone formed on the Huashiban slope.
   The subsequent impact of several small earthquakes on the slope
   increased the tension crack connectivity and the tensile strength
   gradually decreased. Severe rainfall in the rainy season between May and
   October, especially in July and August, decreased the shear strength of
   the bottom sliding surface, resulting in a landslide on the Huashiban
   slope on 28 October 1996. The stability of the Huashiban slope is
   important for plant site selection. If a further landslide occurs on the
   slope, the Liangjiaren Hydropower Station project will be critically
   affected, so analysis of the current slope stability is extremely
   important. At present, the Huashiban slope can be divided into five
   subzones: (1) a landslide deposit zone; (2) a landslide zone; (3) a
   tensile fracture zone; (4) a crescent-shaped zone; and (5) an upper
   slide zone. Using historic landslide data for 28 October 1996,
   retrospective analysis of the landslide process revealed shear strength
   parameters for the Huashiban slope. The cohesion strength is 0.024 MPa,
   the friction angle at the bottom sliding surface is 14, and the tension
   crack connectivity is 50\%. These parameters were used to compute the
   stability of the Huashiban slope. Under the same conditions, the
   stability of the whole slope is better than that of part of the slope,
   and the overall stability is dominated by the tensile fracture zone.
   Under earthquake and rainfall conditions, it is possible that failure
   will occur in the tensile fracture zone. Thus, the Huashiban slope
   should be reinforced for construction and operation of the Liangjiaren
   Hydropower Station. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates how meeting domestic energy production targets

   Although total domestic freshwater consumption is expected to increase

   production is expected to increase by nearly 70\%, and water consumed
   for biofuels (biodiesel and ethanol) production is expected to increase

Abstract = {{Global climate change induced by the emission of greenhouse gases may

   in particular of renewable sources, to climate change raises the need to
   identify adaptation measures. This paper applies an integrated resource

   methodology used has the advantage of finding optimal solutions that

   increased installed capacity based, mostly, on natural gas, but also
   sugarcane bagasse, wind power and coal/nuclear plants, to compensate for
   a lower reliability of hydroelectric production, amongst other impacts.
   The indirect effect of these results is the displacement of natural gas
   from other consuming sectors, such as industry, in favor of its use for
   power generation. Results obtained are, however, based on the
   techno-economic premises used in the simulation, which may vary in the

Abstract = {{This study explores the influence of variable soil depths on simulated

   model over the North American Monsoon (NAM) region of southwestern North

   impact of accounting for shallower soil depths is to increase the
   dispersion, (i.e. the dynamic range) of sensible and latent heat fluxes
   when compared with simulations using a common fixed soil column depth of
   2 meters. It is also shown that accounting for local soil depth
   variability can, moderately, improve land surface model flux estimation
   as compared with tower measurements. This result is directly consistent
   with recent studies relating the sensitivity of the timescale of soil
   moisture variability to plant rooting depth since this impacts the total
   amount of water available for evapotranspiration. Basic sensitivity

Abstract = {{A depth averaged barotropic model is used to quantify the effect of
   tides and storm surges on the energy budget for the coastal waters
   bordering the Northwest Atlantic. The model is first shown capable of
   producing realistic predictions of both tides and surges through
   comparison with independent sea level observations. In particular, it is
   shown that the model can predict tidal range with a typical RMS error of
   20cm, and realistic semi-diurnal to diurnal amplitude ratios. Storm
   surge hindcasts are also shown to be predicted with typical RMS errors
   less than 8 cm. Following successful validation of the model we produce,
   for the first time, spatial maps of maximum speed due to combined tide
   and surge (due to atmospheric forcing) current, tidal only current, and
   surge only current. The model is next used to examine the energy budget
   of the study area. It is shown that the energy flux vectors for the
   semi-diurnal and diurnal tides are very different. 01 vectors tends to
   be more aligned with the bathymetry than the M-2 vectors. Most
   dissipation was found to occur in the high tide region of the Bay of
   Fundy. It is also shown that in the mean (i.e. over a season or a year),
   surges and tide-surge interaction do not play an important role in the
   energy budget. However, during a large surge event this is not true;
   surge and tide-surge interaction can have an order one impact on the
   energy balance. We discuss how such infrequent and unusually large
   events impact the nearshore environment. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Hydropower development brings many negative impacts on watershed
   ecosystems which are not fully integrated into current decision-making
   largely because in practice few accept the cost and benefit beyond
   market. In this paper, a framework was proposed to valuate the effects
   on watershed ecosystem services caused by hydropower development.
   Watershed ecosystem services were classified into four categories of
   provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services; then effects
   on watershed ecosystem services caused by hydropower development were
   identified to 21 indicators. Thereafter various evaluation techniques
   including the market value method, opportunity cost approach, project
   restoration method, travel cost method, and contingent valuation method
   were determined and the models were developed to valuate these
   indicators reflecting specific watershed ecosystem services. This
   approach was applied to three representative hydropower projects
   (Daguan, Xizaikou and Tiangong) of Jiulong River Watershed in southeast
   China. It was concluded that for hydropower development: (1) the value
   ratio of negative impacts to positive benefits ranges from 64.09\% to
   91.18\%, indicating that the negative impacts of hydropower development
   should be critically Studied during its environmental administration
   process; (2) the biodiversity loss and water quality degradation
   (together accounting for 80-94\%) are the major negative impacts on
   watershed ecosystem services: (3) the average environmental cost per
   unit of electricity is up to 0.206 Yuan/kW h, which is about three
   quarters of its on-grid power tariff; and (4) the current water resource
   fee accounts for only about 4\% of its negative impacts value, therefore
   a new compensatory method by paying for ecosystem services is necessary
   for sustainable hydropower development. These findings provide a clear
   picture of both positive and negative effects of hydropower development
   for decision-makers in the monetary term, and also provide a basis for
   further design of environmental instrument such as payment for watershed
   ecosystem services. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydropower is a well established electricity system on the global scene.
   Global electricity needs by fir exceed the amount of electricity that
   hydrosystems can provide to meet global electricity needs. Much of the
   world's hydropower remains to be brought into production improved
   technology, better calibrated environmental parameters for large
   projects have become the norm in the past 15 years. How and why does
   hydropower retain a prominent role in electricity production? How and
   why does hydropower find social acceptance in diverse social systems?
   How does hydropower project planning address issues beyond electricity
   generation? How does the systems approach to hydropower installations
   further analysis of comparative energy sources powering electricity
   systems? Attention to the environmental impact of hydropower facilities
   forms an integral part of systems analysis. Similarly, the technical,
   political and economic variables call for balanced analysis to identify
   the viability status of hydro projects. Economic competition among
   energy systems requires in context assessments as these shape decision
   making in planning of hydropower systems Moreover, technological change
   has to be given a time frame during which the sector advances in
   productivity and share in expanding electricity generation. The low
   production costs per kWh assure hydropower at this juncture, 2009, a
   very viable future. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) with its major river systems has vast
   potential for hydropower development. Recognizing this potential, the
   Government of India in its recent initiative for 50,000 MW power
   generation proposes to develop several hydropower projects in the IHR.
   Based on the understanding of the prevailing policy framework of the
   country for hydropower development, a case study of Alaknanda catchment
   located in Uttarakhand (part of the IHR) is presented. The catchment is
   endowed with vast hydropower potential; however, in the present study,
   some of the important social and environmental issues are raised that
   arise due to dense allocation of hydropower projects in the ecologically
   sensitive Himalayan region. It is recognized that in the Himalayan
   region which is important from the conservation point of view,
   project-specific Environmental Impact Assessment studies are probably
   insufficient to tackle the environmental issues that are likely to
   result on account of the proposed hydropower projects.}},

Abstract = {{A hilly watershed in Kopili River basin in Assam (India) was considered
   for assessment of hydropower potential using spatial tool (GIS) and
   hydrological model (SWAT2000). The available data related to topography,
   soil, land use, weather and discharge pertaining to the study watershed
   were used to characterize the watershed. The characterization was
   required for water resources hence hydropower assessment. The hydrology
   of the study watershed was simulated through the model. The prediction
   accuracy of the model was confirmed through three well known efficiency
   criteria viz., coefficient of determination (R(2) = 0.70),
   Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E = 0.64) and Index of agreement (d = 0.91).
   A total of 107 sites on 9 streams could be identified as potential
   location for hydropower generation in the study watershed using the
   model outputs. Distributed power availability through micro units (<0.5
   MW) has been the characteristic feature of the watershed. Estimated
   potential carbon emission reduction (CER) within the watershed might be
   up to 125 thousand t CO(2), even 50\% of the potential hydropower of the
   1204 sq km watershed could be implemented. The result of the study is
   expected to boost the initiative for hydropower generation in the region
   considering the limitation of fossil fuels, increasing power demand and
   availability of untapped water resources. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {{520-525}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The current recommendations on dietary energy requirements in
   China have been based on total energy expenditure (TEE) derived from
   theoretical factorial calculations expressed as multiples of basal
   energy expenditure (BEE). Few direct measurements of TEE and BEE have
   been conducted in Chinese people. This study was designed to measure the
   TEE and BEE of healthy, light active women of normal body weight living
   in China, and to evaluate the recommendations on dietary energy
   requirements by comparing the data correspondingly. Design: 16 healthy
   female adults aged 22.1 +/- 1.2 y with a body mass index (in kg/m(2)) of
   20.4 +/- 1.7 were selected. Under well-controlled conditions, TEEs were
   determined by using the doubly labeled water method. At the same time,
   BEEs were measured by using indirect calorimetry. Results: Measured TEE
   was 1380 +/- 118 kcal/d, which was close to the value of energy intake
   (1381 +/- 96 kcal/d). Comparing the measured TEE with the recommended
   (Chinese recommended value for this group is 2100 kcal/d), the
   recommended was substantially higher than the measured by 15\% or so.
   Meanwhile, the calculated BEE (1230 +/- 65 kcal/d) by using the adjusted
   Schofield equation proposed by the Chinese Nutrition Society was
   significantly higher (p <0.001) than the measured BEE (1130 +/- 110
   kcal/d), by 9\% or so. Conclusion: Current recommended energy intake for
   young adult women may need to be revised on the basis of measured TEE
   and BEE.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a multistage interval-stochastic regional-scale energy
   model (MIS-REM) is developed for supporting electric power system (EPS)
   planning under uncertainty that is based on a multistage
   interval-stochastic integer linear programming method. The developed
   MIS-REM can deal with uncertainties expressed as both probability
   distributions and interval values existing in energy system planning
   problems. Moreover, it can reflect dynamic decisions for electricity
   generation schemes and capacity expansions through transactions at
   discrete points of a multiple representative scenario set over a
   multistage context. It can also analyze various energy-policy scenarios
   that are associated with economic penalties when the regulated targets
   are violated. A case study is provided for demonstrating the
   applicability of the developed model, where renewable and non-renewable
   energy resources, economic concerns, and environmental requirements are
   integrated into a systematic optimization process. The results obtained
   are helpful for supporting (a) adjustment or justification of allocation
   patterns of regional energy resources and services, (b) formulation of
   local policies regarding energy consumption, economic development, and
   energy structure, and (c) analysis of interactions among economic cost,
   environmental requirement, and energy-supply security. (C) 2009 Elsevier

   species, 306.4, 0.092 and 10.1 mg Kg(-1) for Cu(II), Cd(II) and Pb(II),
   respectively, was determined by aqua regia digestion, followed by atomic
   absorption spectrometry. The results obtained from the sequential
   extraction procedure indicated that about 10\% of Cu(II) and Cd(II) were
   present in the easily mobilized fraction. All the metal species under
   investigation showed a predominance of reducible fraction, i.e., more
   than 50\%, while the metal content in the third fraction (oxidizable)
   varied from 12 to 35\%. The metal recovery rate was good, with no
   significant difference between the amount of metals recovered through
   the extractant steps and the extractable metals (aqua regia). The
   results indicate that the sediment poses a risk to aquatic organisms,
   since a slight change in physical chemical parameters such as pH can
   mobilize this species to the water column.}},

Abstract = {{In semi-arid zones, the lack of surface water for drinking forced
   predators to obtain it from the body fluids of prey and this requires
   more different prey than that needed to provide energy alone. We
   examined Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) scats to ascertain if selective feeding
   compensates the shortage of free water by the ingestion of more prey
   rich in water such as insects. In addition, we discussed our results in
   light of increasing habitat fragmentation that, in turn, influences the
   prey availability. At different spatial levels, recombination of prey
   assemblages in the diet reaches a solution for variable shortage of
   water. This was true especially at the landscape level (different degree
   of aridity) and indirectly for habitat types. Nevertheless, the effects
   of landscape characteristics probably influenced foxes through the
   influence of suitable habitats, which partitioned prey species. In fact,
   increasing values of patchiness had a negative effect on measured
   energetic gain indices but foxes try to exploiting different patches
   including small and isolated ones because these surveys become important
   to obtain water moistures from alternative prey (Orthopters).}},

Abstract = {{The vulnerability of real-life networks subject to intentional attacks
   has been one of the outstanding challenges in the study of the network
   safety. Applying the real data of the US power grid, we compare the
   effects of two different attacks for the network robustness against
   cascading failures, i.e., removal by either the descending or ascending
   orders of the loads. Adopting the initial load of a node j to be L-j =
   {[}k(j)(Sigma(m is an element of Gamma j)k(m))](alpha) with k(j) and
   Gamma(j) being the degree of the node j and the set of its neighboring
   nodes, respectively, where alpha is a tunable parameter and governs the
   strength of the initial load of a node, we investigate the response of
   the US power grid under two attacks during the cascading propagation. In
   the case of alpha < 0.7. our investigation by the numerical simulations
   leads to a counterintuitive finding on the US power grid that the attack
   on the nodes with the lowest loads is more harmful than the attack on
   the ones with the highest loads. In addition, the almost same effect of
   two attacks in the case of a = 0.7 may be useful in furthering studies
   on the control and defense of cascading failures in the US power grid.

Abstract = {{With the operation of long transmission lines, unknown severe vibration
   and noise in transformers have sometimes been observed at the Shanghe
   substation and at the Ling'ao nuclear power plant in China. This paper
   gives a comparison of magnetic-storm recordings and measured transformer
   neutral current data and confirms that the disturbances were caused by
   geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). On November 7 and 9, 2004, the
   maximum GIC at the Ling'ao nuclear power plant was 47.2 A and 75.5 A,
   respectively, which are both larger than the neutral dc current caused
   by the HVdc monopole operation. The analysis of GIC data indicates that
   the GIC level is mainly determined by the geomagnetic-field variation
   rate, but the earth conductivity and power grid parameters are also
   important factors affecting GIC values. The data show that the GIC level
   is higher at the Ling'ao nuclear power plant than at the Shanghe
   substation. The reason is considered to be related to the grid structure
   and to the coast effect. Furthermore, because of smaller resistances,
   longer transmission lines, a larger scale, and the adoption of
   single-phase transformers, the influences of GIC on the ultra-high
   voltage power grid being constructed in China need to be studied more

Abstract = {{The use of water wasted in hydroelectric plants as normalization dam
   excess, which constitute a hydrodynamic potential useful to generate
   electric energy which can be subsequently used to produce hydrogen and
   its subsequent consumption in fuel cells, has been considered as an
   alternative for hydraulic energy-rich countries like Brazil. The case is
   examined in which all the water wasted in the hydroelectric plants,
   spilled by dam gates to maintain acceptable water levels, from the 101
   largest Brazilian hydroelectric plants was used to produce hydrogen.
   During the year of 2008, the electric energy produced from this
   utilisation would have been equivalent to 106.2 TWh, an amount that
   corresponds to an increase of ca. 30\% of the total electric energy
   produced in the country. Furthermore, if this amount of hydrogen was
   used in the replacement of internal combustion vehicles by fuel cells,
   this would have prevented the production of 2,000,000 tons of CO2
   emissions per day. The economic balance (cost of electricity produced
   using the wasted water minus cost of gasoline consumed) indicates a
   savings of ca. 200 million US\$. This plan would also significantly
   decrease production and release of greenhouse gases. (C) 2009 Professor

Abstract = {{Large dams represent a whole complex of social, economic and ecological
   processes, perhaps more than any other large infrastructure project.
   Today, countries with rapidly developing economies are constructing new
   dams to provide energy and flood control to growing populations in
   riparian and distant urban communities. If the system is lacking
   institutional capacity to absorb these physical and institutional
   changes there is potential for conflict, thereby threatening human
   security. In this paper, we propose analyzing sustainability (political,
   socioeconomic, and ecological) in terms of resilience versus
   vulnerability, framed within the spatial abstraction of a powershed. The
   powershed framework facilitates multi-scalar and transboundary analysis
   while remaining focused on the questions of resilience and vulnerability
   relating to hydropower dams.
   Focusing on examples from China, this paper describes the complex nature
   of dams using the sustainability and powershed frameworks. We then
   analyze the roles of institutions in China to understand the
   relationships between power, human security and the socio-ecological
   system. To inform the study of conflicts over dams China is a
   particularly useful case study because we can examine what happens at
   the international, national and local scales. The powershed perspective
   allows us to examine resilience and vulnerability across political
   boundaries from a dynamic, process-defined analytical scale while
   remaining focused on a host of questions relating to hydro-development
   that invoke drivers and impacts on national and sub-national scales. The
   ability to disaggregate the affects of hydropower dam construction from
   political boundaries allows for a deeper analysis of resilience and
   vulnerability. From our analysis we find that reforms in China's
   hydropower sector since 1996 have been motivated by the need to create
   stability at the national scale rather than resilient solutions to
   China's growing demand for energy and water resource control at the
   local and international scales. Some measures that improved economic
   development through the market economy and a combination of dam
   construction and institutional reform may indeed improve hydro-political
   resilience at a single scale. However, if China does address large-scale
   hydropower construction's potential to create multi-scale geopolitical
   tensions, they may be vulnerable to conflict - though not necessarily
   violent - in domestic and international political arenas. We conclude
   with a look toward a resilient basin institution for the Nu/Salween
   River, the site of a proposed large-scale hydropower development effort
   in China and Myanmar. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   impacts. We studied upstream and downstream reaches of three British
   Columbia Hydro reservoirs on the Allouette, Coquitlam, and Cheakamus
   Rivers to determine if riparian plant communities were affected by the
   dams. We determined cover of all plants in consecutive 1 m(2) quadrats
   along five to six 14 m-long belt transects in each 300 m upstream and
   downstream sections of these rivers. We encountered 166 plant species in
   a total of 448 quadrats. Differences in plant communities (abundance,
   species richness, diversity) amongst rivers were larger than that
   between the upstream versus downstream of the rivers. This suggests that
   any difference caused by reservoir management was within the natural
   range of variation found across the rivers. We found significant
   reductions in the occurrences of red alder and western red cedar
   downstream of reservoirs. The lack of regeneration of these two species
   maybe attributable to the reduction in extremes of flow variation and
   lack of sediment transport due to the reservoirs. Coordinated flow
   management can help mitigate these downstream impacts. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Topsoil samples (0-20 cm) were collected from the upstream and
   downstream riverine zones of a Manwan hydroelectric dam on the Lancang
   River in October, 2005. Total concentrations of seven heavy metals, that
   is, arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), cadium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni),
   lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in soils were determined using the inductively
   coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry in order to assess their
   contamination levels of the upstream and downstream riverine zones of a
   hydroelectric dam. Results showed that the average concentrations of
   these heavy metals in the upstream riverine soils were significantly
   lower than those in the downstream ones. Average heavy metal
   concentrations were generally lower in the upstream riverine soils and
   higher in the downstream compared with the respective background value.
   Contamination indices showed no contamination for As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb,
   and Zn, and low contamination levels for Cd in all of the upstream soil
   samples. However, they showed low contamination levels for As, Cr, Cu,
   and Ni, and no contamination for Pb and Zn, while moderate contamination
   for Cd in the downstream riverine soils. Integrated contamination index
   was moderate for the downstream area, but showed no contamination for
   the upstream area. Using factor analysis a strong association among
   these heavy metals indicating the same contamination source was found.
   This work could provide a new quantitative index for environmental
   impact assessments of hydroelectric development and contributed to
   building an integrated assessment index system.}},

Abstract = {{Through an Australia-China climate change bilateral project, we analyzed
   results of 51-year global offline simulations over China using the
   Australian community atmosphere biosphere land exchange (CABLE) model,
   focusing on integrated studies of its surface energy, water and carbon
   cycle at seasonal, interannual and longer time-scales. In addition to
   the similar features in surface climatology between the CABLE simulation
   and those derived from the global land-surface data assimilation system,
   comparison of surface fluxes at a CEOP reference site in northeast China
   also suggested that the seasonal cycles of surface evaporation and CO2
   flux are reasonably simulated by the model. We further assessed temporal
   variations of model soil moisture with the observed variations at a
   number of locations in China. Observations show a soil moisture
   recharge-discharge mechanism on a seasonal time scale in central-east
   China, with soil moisture being recharged during its summer wet season,
   retained in its winter due to low evaporation demand, and depleted
   during early spring when the land warms up. Such a seasonal cycle is
   shown at both 50- and 100-cm soil depths in observations while the model
   only shows a similar feature in its lower soil layers with its upper
   layer soil moisture varying tightly with rainfall seasonal cycle. In the
   analysis of the model carbon cycle, the net primary productivity (NPP)
   has similar spatial patterns as the ones derived from an ecosystem model
   with remote sensing. The simulated interannual variations of NPP by
   CABLE are consistent with the results derived from remote sensing-based
   and process-based studies over the period of 1981-2000. Nevertheless an
   upward trend from observations is not presented in the model results.
   The model shows a downward trend primarily due to the constant CO2
   concentration used in the experiment and a large increase of autotrophic
   respiration caused by an upward trend in surface temperature forcing
   data. Furthermore, we have compared river discharge data from the model
   experiments with observations in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins in
   China. In the Yangtze River basin, while the observed interannual
   variability is reasonably captured, the model significantly
   underestimates its river discharge, which is consist with its
   overestimation of evaporation in the region. In the Yellow River basin,
   the magnitudes of the river discharge is similar between modeled and
   observed but its variations are less skillfully captured as seen in the
   Yangtze River region.}},

Abstract = {{During the second half of the 20th century the global food production
   more than doubled and thus responded to the doubling of world
   population. But the gains in food production came at a cost, leaving a
   significant environmental footprint on the ecosystem. Global cropland,
   plantations and pastures expanded, with large increases in fossil
   energy, water, and fertilizer inputs, imprinting considerable footprint
   on the environment. Information from pre eminent publications such as
   Nature, Science, PNAS and scholarly journals is synthesized to assess
   the water and energy footprints of global food production. The data show
   that the footprints are significant, both locally, national and globally
   and have consequences for global food security and ecosystem health and
   productivity. The literature nearly agrees that global food production
   system generates considerable environmental footprints and the situation
   would likely get worrisome, as global population grows by 50\% by 2050.
   Investments are needed today to buffer the negative impacts of food
   production on the environment. Investments to boost water productivity
   and improve energy use efficiency in crop production are two pathways to
   reduce the environmental footprint. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A distributed model for simulating the land surface hydrological
   processes in the Heihe river basin was developed and validated on the
   basis of considering the physical mechanism of hydrological cycle and
   the artificial system of water utilization in the basin. Modeling
   approach of every component process was introduced from 2 aspects, i.e.,
   water cycle and energy cycle. The hydrological processes include
   evapotranspiration, infiltration, runoff, groundwater flow, interaction
   between groundwater and river water, overland flow, river flow and
   artificial cycle processes of water utilization. A simulation of 21
   years from 1982 to 2002 was carried out after obtaining various input
   data and model parameters. The model was validated for both the
   simulation of monthly discharge process and that of daily discharge
   process. Water budgets and spatial and temporal variations of
   hydrological cycle components as well as energy cycle components in the
   upper and middle reach Heihe basin (36 728 km(2)) were studied by using
   the distributed hydrological model. In addition, the model was further
   used to predict the water budgets under the future land surface change
   scenarios in the basin. The modeling results show: (1) in the upper
   reach watershed, the annual average evapotranspiration and runoff
   account for 63\% and 37\% of the annual precipitation, respectively, the
   snow melting runoff accounts for 19\% of the total runoff and 41\% of
   the direct runoff, and the groundwater storage has no obvious change;
   (2) in the middle reach basin, the annual average evapotranspiration is
   52 mm more than the local annual precipitation, and the groundwater
   storage is of an obvious declining trend because of irrigation water
   consumption; (3) for the scenario of conservation forest construction in
   the upper reach basin, although the evapotranspiration from interception
   may increase, the soil evaporation may reduce at the same time,
   therefore the total evapotranspiration may not increase obviously; the
   measure of changing the farmland to pasture land in the middle reach
   basin has obvious effects on decreasing evapotranspiration, increasing
   the discharge at Zhengyixia, and decreasing the storage deficit;
   reducing the irrigation surface water use in the middle reach basin has
   obvious functions on increasing the discharge to downstream but the
   groundwater exploitation increasing should be restricted to prevent the
   groundwater table decline.}},

Abstract = {{Inter-area oscillation has become a prominent stability problem in AC
   connected power systems, but wide area damping control (WADC) has great
   potential in solving this problem. The main difference between WADC and
   conventional local control is that in WADC signals are transmitted over
   long distances, and, thus, the time delay involved in the control loop
   cannot be ignored. An experimental system was built based on real-time
   digital simulators, a real WADC system and phasor measurement units, to
   investigate the impact of the time delay. In the experiments, the WADC
   was implemented on the Gao-Zhao HVDC supplementary control in the China
   southern power grid. The results revealed a phenomenon high-frequency
   constant amplitude oscillation caused by time delay. This phenomenon was
   successfully explained using the frequency-domain stability analysis
   method. Furthermore, a compensation block and a band-pass filter were
   used to prevent the negative impacts of time-delay on the stability
   margin and the damping performance. The method for designing their
   parameters is also described. Physical experimental results show the
   effectiveness of this method.}},

Abstract = {{Robust yet simple remote sensing methodologies for mapping instantaneous
   land-surface fluxes of water, energy and CO2 exchange within a coupled
   framework add significant value to large-scale monitoring networks like
   FLUXNET, facilitating upscaling of tower flux observations to address
   questions of regional carbon cycling and water availability. This study
   investigates the implementation of an analytical, light-use efficiency
   (WE) based model of canopy resistance within a Two-Source Energy Balance
   (TSEB) scheme driven primarily by thermal remote sensing inputs. The WE
   model computes coupled canopy-scale carbon assimilation and
   transpiration fluxes, and replaces a Priestley-Taylor (PT) based
   transpiration estimate used in the original form of the TSEB model. In
   turn, the thermal remote sensing data provide valuable diagnostic
   information about the sub-surface moisture status, obviating the need
   for precipitation input data and prognostic modeling of the soil water
   balance. Both the WE and PT forms of the model are compared with eddy
   covariance tower measurements acquired in rangeland near El Reno, OK.
   The WE method resulted in improved partitioning of the surface energy
   budget, capturing effects of midday stomatal closure in response to
   increased vapor pressure deficit and reducing errors in half-hourly flux
   predictions from 16 to 12\%. The spatial distribution of CO2 flux was
   mapped over the El Reno study area using data from an airborne thermal
   imaging system and compared to fluxes measured by an aircraft flying a
   transect over rangeland, riparian areas, and harvested winter wheat.
   Soil respiration contributions to the net carbon flux were modeled
   spatially using remotely sensed estimates of soil surface temperature,
   soil moisture, and leaf area index. Modeled carbon and water fluxes from
   this heterogeneous landscape compared well in magnitude and spatial
   pattern to the aircraft fluxes. The thermal inputs proved to be valuable
   in modifying the effective WE from a nominal species-dependent value.
   The model associates cooler canopy temperatures with enhanced
   transpiration, indicating higher canopy conductance and carbon
   assimilation rates. The surface energy balance constraint in this
   modeling approach provides a useful and physically intuitive mechanism
   for incorporating subtle signatures of soil moisture deficiencies and
   reduced stomatal aperture, manifest in the thermal band signal, into the
   coupled carbon and water flux estimates. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a novel model and an algorithm of security region
   based real and reactive power pricing of power systems. In the proposed
   model, the reactive power production cost is represented as the
   opportunity cost. The static voltage stability region in the cut set

   the injection power space are used to represent the constraints of
   voltage stability and transient stability, so that the consideration of
   this kind of constraints in the optimization becomes very easy. In the
   proposed algorithm, a decoupled optimization and iteration method of
   active power production cost and reactive power production cost is
   suggested. According to the K-T optimality conditions, the prices of
   active power and reactive power, and the different components
   corresponding to the concerned security constraints are derived. The
   components of spot prices can reflect the influence of different node
   power injections on each kind of security constraints, so that through
   the node price all of the participants in power market can be stimulated
   to take an active part in maintaining the system security. An

   the sensible and latent. heat, fluxes showed a linear dependence on the
   global solar radiation. However. in the non-growing season, the latent
   heat flux was always less than 50 W m(-2), while the available energy
   was dissipated as sensible. rather than latent heat flux. During the
   growing season in 2003-05, the daily average sensible and latent heat,
   fluxes were larger on the cropland surface than on the degraded
   grassland surface. The cropland ecosystem absorbed more CO2 than the
   degraded grassland ecosystem in the growing season in 2003-05. The total

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the entry problem in the hydroelectric generation
   industry. The operation of an upstream generator regularizes the river
   flow for generators located downstream on the same river, increasing the

   the attractiveness of the locations downstream whenever a generator
   decides to enter upstream. Therefore, the entry decision of a generator
   in a given location may affect all entry decisions in potential
   locations for plants downstream. This type of externality takes place
   whenever the first firm to enter in a market facilitates the following
   entries. I first develop a method to estimate an entry model specific to
   this type of externality, considering the specifications of the
   hydro-generation industry. At last, I use a data set on investment
   decisions of Brazilian hydro-generators to estimate the model. The
   results show a positive incentive to locate downstream both from
   existing plants and from locations where entry is likely to occur. An
   interesting by-product of this analysis is that the year effects'
   estimates show an increase one year before the energy crisis of 2001,
   providing evidence that the market had anticipated the crisis. It
   contradicts the governmental version that the crisis was due to an

Abstract = {{Hydro-Quebec's Toulnustouc hydroelectric complex is located
   approximately 120 km north of Baie-Comeau on the Quebec North Shore
   region. The project involved the construction of a 77-m-high dam and a
   45-m-high dike that allowed the expansion of an existing 235 km(2)
   reservoir by some 22 km2. When completely filled, the new part of the
   reservoir has a maximum depth of 75 m. Starting on 10 February 2005 and
   over a period of four days, the water of the original reservoir was used
   to start filling the new part. The water level of the entire reservoir
   increased by another 10 m after the spring snowmelt. The project also
   included a 9.8-km-long headrace tunnel constructed in Precambrian
   bedrock that creates a 170-m water head between the reservoir and the
   powerhouse. Electricity production started in May 2005. The complex is
   located in an area of low-level earthquake activity on the Canadian
   Shield. Four stations of the Canada National Seismograph Network (CNSN)
   located within 100 km of the reservoir provide a location threshold with
   a magnitude of about 1.2 (m(N)). To complement the CNSN, two portable
   seismographs were installed near the flooded area and the headrace
   tunnel about one week before flooding started. Between February and
   mid-May 2005, a total of four triggered earthquakes were recorded by the
   field instruments and the CNSN stations. The first event, a magnitude
   1.4 (m(N)), occurred 16 days after flooding of the extension of the
   reservoir started. Three events were located beneath the reservoir and
   one was near the tunnel between the reservoir and the powerhouse where
   the water pressure is most intense. Numerous smaller but unlocatable
   events (m(N) < 1.0) were detected by one of the field stations. About
   two years later, two events separated by one minute and recognized as
   multiplets occurred near the reservoir. The small stress perturbations
   that led to the reservoir-triggered seismicity at Toulnustouc support
   the hypothesis that the mid to upper crust of intraplate areas is in a
   state of stress close to failure.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To evaluate the relative importance of water-energy, land-cover,
   environmental heterogeneity and spatial variables on the regional
   distribution of Red-Listed and common vascular plant species richness.
   Location Trento Province (c. 6200 km(2)) on the southern border of the
   European Alps (Italy), subdivided regularly into 228 3' x 5' quadrants.
   Methods Data from a floristic inventory were separated into two subsets,
   representing Red-Listed and common (i.e. all except Red-Listed) plant
   species richness. Both subsets were separately related to water-energy,
   land-cover and environmental heterogeneity variables. We simultaneously
   applied ordinary least squares regression with variation partitioning
   and hierarchical partitioning, attempting to identify the most important
   factors controlling species richness. We combined the analysis of
   environmental variables with a trend surface analysis and a spatial
   autocorrelation analysis.
   Results At the regional scale, plant species richness of both Red-Listed
   and common species was primarily related to energy availability and land
   cover, whereas environmental heterogeneity had a lesser effect. The
   greatest number of species of both subsets was found in quadrants with
   the largest energy availability and the greatest degree of urbanization.
   These findings suggest that the elevation range within our study region
   imposes an energy-driven control on the distribution of species
   richness, which resembles that of the broader latitude gradient.
   Overall, the two species subsets had similar trends concerning the
   relative importance of water-energy, land cover and environmental
   heterogeneity, showing a few differences regarding the selection of some
   predictors of secondary importance. The incorporation of spatial
   variables did not improve the explanatory power of the environmental
   models and the high original spatial autocorrelation in the response
   variables was reduced drastically by including the selected
   environmental variables.
   Main conclusions Water-energy and land cover showed significant pure
   effects in explaining plant species richness, indicating that climate
   and land cover should both be included as explanatory variables in
   modelling species richness in human-affected landscapes. However, the
   high degree of shared variation between the two groups made the relative
   effects difficult to separate. The relatively low range of variation in
   the environmental heterogeneity variables within our sampling domain
   might have caused the low importance of this complex factor.}},

Abstract = {{Government (Fisheries and Oceans Canada) and industry (Abitibi
   Consolidated Company of Canada) have been working cooperatively to
   protect and enhance wild Atlantic salmon populations on the Exploits
   River, insular Newfoundland, Canada. Since the mid-1960s, enhancement
   programmes and construction of fish passage facilities at natural and
   man-made barriers in the watershed have expanded the range and increased
   the returning adult population from 1200 fish (circa 1960) to 22,000
   fish, on average. Since 1997, attention has been paid to improving
   passage and survival of downstream migrating smolts and kelts at two
   hydroelectric facilities at Grand Falls-Windsor and Bishops Falls. At
   Grand Falls-Windsor a floating louver and bypass system was installed in
   a power canal and extensive biological, hydraulic, and modelling studies
   have been conducted to assess, modify, and optimize fish passage. At
   Bishops Falls, a retrofitted surface spill bypass system was installed
   in an existing spill gate and similar studies have been conducted to
   improve passage success. Studies have also been conducted on the
   upstream migrating adults at these facilities and associated fishways,
   using conventional and physiological telemetry, to assess tailrace
   attraction and residency, and the relative energy cost of upstream
   migration to bypass the hydro plants and fishways. This article reviews
   the results of these various studies to demonstrate how cooperative work
   has improved passage of anadromous salmon in coexistence with
   hydroelectric development.}},

   further intended to be a test-bed for comparing methods of simulating
   electric power systems and electricity markets operating under
   engineering constraints. It can, for example, be used for power flow,
   optimal power flow, reliability, market clearing, and other economic

Abstract = {{The oil sands mining industry in Canada is required to return mining
   areas to a land capability equivalent to that which existed prior to
   mining. During the reclamation process, ecosystems are created that bear
   little similarity to boreal forests that existed prior to mining.
   Quantifying the water balance of reclaimed ecosystems is critical in
   establishing whether there is sufficient moisture for vegetation growth
   and in the fate of salts, which can be toxic when drawn to the surface
   or leached out of the covers. At Syncrude Canada Ltd's Mildred Lake mine
   north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, the surface energy balance was measured
   atop a reclaimed saline-sodic overburden pile during three growing
   seasons using eddy covariance. At the onset of the study, the dominant
   vegetation was foxtail barley, which changed to sweet clover in 2004,
   and a low-density species mix in 2005, including some aspen and white
   spruce seedlings. The 2005 growing season was cooler and wetter than
   2003 and 2004, and there were seasonal differences in the delivery of
   precipitation among years. There were distinct differences in the
   surface energy balance among the study years related to weather, soil
   moisture, vegetation and stage of growth. Latent heat was the largest
   consumer of energy in 2003, and mid-day fluxes of sensible and latent
   heat were approximately equal. In 2004, sensible heat became the
   dominant flux, primarily due to prolonged dry periods, whereas the wet
   2005 season had the greatest latent heat flux density of any year.
   Ground heat flux declined throughout the growing season and ranged
   between 3 and 17\% of net radiation. Total evapotranspiration was 246,
   224 and 283 turn for 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. A total
   derivative analysis of the Penman-Monteith equation reveals the
   influence of available energy, vapour pressure deficit and surface
   conductance in controlling evapotranspiration. Copyright (c) 2008 John

   the 7th and 10th, November, 2004, the maximal magnetic storm caused GIC
   in Ling'ao Nuclear Station was 47A and 55.8A, both larger than the
   transformer neutral DC level in HVDC's monopole operation, so, magnetic
   storms' instantaneous influence is larger than HVDC's. And the data show
   that GIC level in Guangdong Power Grid is higher than that of the
   Yang-Huai power transmission system, by initial analysis it's considered
   to be related with grid structure and coast effect etc. By now, the
   widely concerned 1000kV UHV power transmission system has begun
   constructing, and the UHV line's unit resistance will be at most half of
   the 500 kV line's, and in condition of longer transmission line, larger

Abstract = {{Pachyurus schomburgkii Gunther, 1860 and P. paucirustrus Aguilera, 1983
   occur in the Tocantins-Araguaia basin, where the latter is endemic. The
   species were found in the upper Tocantins, in the region where it was
   impounded by the Serra da Mesa hydroelectric dam. Fourteen sites were
   sampled but both species were restricted to two sites (FU and PG)
   located downstream from the dam. Fishes were bimonthly captured from
   December 1995 to December 2002 with standardized gillnets. We present
   data on the distribution, diet, physiological condition and the
   reproductive status of these species, and focus on the alterations
   related to the impoundment. Most specimens were adult, and the number of
   reproductive individuals decreased after damming. Species were
   classified as benthic invertivores, feeding mainly on immature insects.
   Niche breadth was significantly higher to P. paucirastrus, and, for both
   species, during the pre-impoundment phase. Interspecific diet overlap
   was high: however, resource partitioning was more pronounced in the site
   immediately downstream from the dam (FU) than partitioning in the more
   distant site (PG). Values relative to the condition factor indicated
   that P schomburgkii must have profited more effectively from the
   available resources after the environmental changes than P.
   paucirastrus. Thus, factors related to feeding might have contributed to
   the disappearance of this species after the beginning of power plant
   operation. Pachyurus schomburgkii seems to have had a better adjustment
   to changes, and was more persistent in the area after the damming;
   however, it remained restricted to the more distant site, where it had
   been occasionally captured until it was no longer found, approximately
   four years after dam closure. Considering that many impoundments are
   planned to the rio Tocantins, we recommend further studies about P.
   paucirastrus in other stretches of the basin, in order to evaluate the
   conservation status of this species.}},

Abstract = {{Cool-water carbonate environments are responsible for up to one third of
   the carbonate sediment produced on continental shelves, and are useful
   modern analogues for many geologically ancient carbonate deposits. On
   modern and ancient high wave-energy carbonate ramps, it has been
   suggested that wave abrasion generally limits sediment accumulation to
   the outer shelf. Sediment are produced on the modern inner shelf,
   although few studies have investigated processes of sedimentation in
   these energetic environments. The Recherche Archipelago, in the west of
   the Great Australian Bight (GAB), was examined to better identify
   processes of carbonate sedimentation and preservation on extremely high
   energy shelves. Surficial sediments, video traverses, multibeam sonar
   data, cores and shallow seismics were analysed. These data reveal that
   the topographically varied environment of the Recherche Archipelago
   experienced gradual, episodic accumulation of a prograding sediment
   wedge, with substantially thicker deposits located on the lee side of
   topographic highs. Modern sediment accumulation is largely restricted to
   the shoreface and inner shelf, where the highly discontinuous, storm
   influenced blanket of Holocene sediment comprises a shore-attached
   quartzose sediment prism, leeward accretionary wedges and rhodolith beds
   above a laterally-continuous Pecten-dominated basal transgressive lag.
   Storm events play an important role in these environments, resulting in
   a mostly bare `shaved' middle and outer shelf, onshore sediment
   transport, reworking of particles and periodic removal of sediment. The
   modern Recherche Archipelago is a high energy end-member of cool-water
   carbonate environments, in which calcareous algae dominate sediment
   production. Modern Esperance Bay provides a useful analogue for the
   interpretation of high-energy palaeoenvironments, and demonstrates that
   in addition to sea level change, wave energy and local geomorphology are
   important considerations for carbonate facies reconstructions. This
   study has presented new information for carbonate inner shelves that
   differs from classic carbonate ramp models, showing that ancient
   rhodolith-bearing carbonate deposits have the potential to form and be
   preserved in very high energy settings. Crown Copyright (C) 2008

   latent heat flux (LE) and a decrease in sensible heat flux (H), which
   caused an increase in the ratio of LE and net radiation (LE/ Rn) from
   0.6 to 0.8 on average, and a decrease in H/Rn from 0.4 to 0.2 on average
   for the growing season. However, where the marshland was converted to
   soybean cropland, the latent heat flux was tower in 2005 under dry
   conditions, but higher in 2006 under wet conditions than it had been
   previously been, which was the opposite of the trend of H. Therefore,
   LE/Rn for soybean dropped to about 0.2 in the dry month of June 2005,
   and rose to 0.7 in the wet month of June 2006. H/Rn for soybeans shows
   opposite variation in LE/Rn in both years. The maximum
   evapotranspiration (ET) was about 4.5, 6-7 and 5 mm day(-1) for
   marshland, rice and soybeans, respectively. Rn, air temperature (Ta),
   vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and leaf area index (LAI) were important
   environmental and biological factors controlling the seasonal dynamics
   of LE and H for the three ecosystems, which explains about 80\% of LE
   and 50\% of H for marshland and rice; and 30-50\% of LE and 60\% of H
   for soybeans. Among them, Rn was the primary variable controlling the
   variations of LE and H for marshland and rice. However, for soybeans,
   VPD played a more important role in LE under dry conditions. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{The clean development mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol provides
   Annex-I countries with an incentive to invest in emission reduction
   projects in non-Annex-I countries to achieve a reduction in carbon
   dioxide (CO2) emissions at lowest cost that also promotes sustainable
   development in the host country. Small hydro power (SHP) projects could
   be of interest under the CDM because they directly displace greenhouse
   gas emissions while contributing to sustainable rural development, if
   developed correctly. An attempt has been made to estimate the CDM
   potential of SHP projects in India. The preliminary estimates indicate
   that, there is a vast theoretical potential of CO2 mitigation by the use
   of SHP projects in India. On the basis of available literature, the
   gross potential of SHP projects is more than 15GW. The annual CER
   potential of technically feasible SHP projects in India could
   theoretically reach 24 million tons. Under more realistic assumptions
   about diffusion of SHP projects based on past experiences with the
   government-run programmes, annual CER volumes by 2012 could reach 7-20
   and 13-24 million by 2021). CDM could help to achieve the maximum
   utilization potential of SHP projects more rapidly as compared with the
   current diffusion trend if supportive policies are introduced. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{The conservation of large water resources is essential for the

   the speciation of chemical substances that indicate the presence of
   anthropogenic contamination in water resources are of great importance.
   This paper presents the results of analysis for the determination of
   organic, inorganic and total phosphorus, pseudo-sulfur, and iron and
   manganese, in five fractions, in water sediments collected from the
   Capivara Hydroelectric Power Plant, Brazil. A study on the seasonal
   variation of these parameters was conducted, with data having been
   collected in the winter and in the summer, at two sites along the dam, 5
   km apart, close to the city of Primeiro de Maio. Phosphorous was found
   in sediments and adjacent soil in the organic form (OP), and was used as
   an indicator of anthropogenic influence on the reservoir banks.
   Speciation of potentially toxic Mn showed that it is present in the
   exchangeable fraction of the 0-5 cm depth layer (sediment/water
   interface), making its transfer to the water column possible. Results
   from this study showed that domestic and industrial effluent treatment

   sizes ranging from 12 to 60 mm between opposite knots. Two methods were
   used for determining diet: frequency of occurrence and relative volume,
   which were used to calculate the alimentary index (IAi). Diet similarity
   between species was analyzed by applying the Morisita index. Bryconops
   alburnoides ingested 12 items and B. caudomaculatus 10, with a 59\%
   similarity between ingested items. Terrestrial insects for B.
   alburnoides and immature insects for B. caudomaculatus were the main
   items in their diets, and therefore, they were considered insectivorous.
   The seasonal composition of the diet of B. alburnoides was influenced by

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of phase measurement unit and wide area

   control has been paid more and more attention. Since there is obvious
   time delay in WAMS measurement, it is important to properly evaluate the
   impact of time delays on power system stability analysis and controller

   of differential algebraic equation with time delay is first reviewed as
   the necessary theoretical background. Then an optimal-based algorithm is
   given to trace boundaries of the small signal stability region with
   considering the time delay. Finally, two simple systems are employed to
   do some verification studies. It is found that time delay has
   significant influence to the boundary of the small signal stability
   region, especially when the time lag is large. This paper is helpful to
   properly consider the effect of time delay in power system controller

   important to better understand patterns of resource use within the
   Chinese economy and the vulnerability of its growth to resource

   scarcest resources-energy and water-focusing on the energy implications
   of water use. Based on an analysis of economy-wide resource flows using
   China's input-output tables, we draw three overarching conclusions:
   First, the energy used both directly and indirectly in providing
   non-agricultural water currently represents only a small fraction of
   China's total energy consumption. However, this share is set to increase
   as the country expands its water treatment capacity and hydraulic
   infrastructure. A lifecycle assessment framework for evaluating these
   projects would aid policymakers as they choose between more and less
   energy-intensive modes of water provision. Second, energy-water price
   interactions are currently of little relevance to policymakers because
   water prices are low, but the high electricity-intensity of water
   treatment facilities and their need to recover costs may change this
   situation. Third, water ``migration{''} from agriculture to
   non-agricultural uses will have important energy dimensions, which will
   be important for policymakers to bear in mind as they design water
   pricing and conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological effects of the cascade hydropower dam construction on
   ecosystems have acquired much concern from scientists with the expanding
   of dam development scales in the Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region. In the
   Lancang River region and Yuanjiang River-Red River region of the
   Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region (LRGR), an index system has been
   therefore established to assess the current ecological vulnerability and
   to predict the likely future ecological vulnerability of these two river
   regions after the dam constructions. Eight cascade hydropower dam
   construction scenarios have been established in this paper for forecast.
   Abrupt change characteristics of the ecosystem have been considered in
   the calculation. Economic benefits like current supply, navigation and
   tourisms of the dam construction have not been considered in the
   calculation. The results show that (1) the current ecological
   vulnerability values of Lancang River region and Yuanjiang River-Red
   River region are 0.34 and 0.43 respectively, which would rise to
   0.90-0.91 and 0.86-0.89 respectively after the joint work of all the
   planned dams; (2) abrupt change would happen to both the Lancang River
   region and Yuanjiang River-Red River region in future; (3) interval
   construction with high human response is recommended for both the
   Lancang River region and Yuanjiang River-Red River region, after which
   their likely ecological vulnerability would rise to 0.56-0.62 and
   0.42-0.43 respectively. These results provide a reasonable method and
   theoretical references to assess the ecological effects of dam
   construction, and also give prewarnings to other mainstreams of the

   first found in the Neotropical region in 1991. Since then it has
   dispersed upstream in the Plata and Guaiba basins at a rate of 240 km

   caused by Dreissena polymorpha. This paper describes the biology of L.

   suggest the importance of knowing the biology of the invading species
   and the need to consider the settlement patterns and densities of larvae

   prevention/control of macrofouling. This study acquires a global

Abstract = {{Mercury (Hg) concentrations in fish in boreal reservoirs have been shown
   to be increased for up to 3 decades after impoundment. However, the time
   course of increased concentrations is not well known. The purpose of
   this study was to determine the evolution of Hg concentrations in fish
   in the boreal reservoirs of northern Manitoba, Canada, and its
   relationship with severity of flooding. We determined total Hg
   concentrations in three species of fish for up to 35 years after
   impoundment in 14 lakes and lake basins. Postimpoundment trends depended
   on fish species and reservoir. In the benthivorous lake whitefish
   (Coregonus clupeaformis), Hg concentrations increased after flooding to
   between 0.2 and 0.4 mu g g(-1) wet weight compared with preimpoundment
   concentrations between 0.06 and 0.14 mu g g(-1) and concentrations in
   natural lakes between 0.03 and 0.06 mu g g(-1). Hg concentrations in
   lake whitefish were usually highest within 6 years after lake
   impoundment and took 10 to 20 years after impoundment to decrease to
   background concentrations in most reservoirs. Hg concentrations in
   predatory northern pike (Esox lucius) and walleye (Sander vitreus) were
   highest 2 to 8 years after flooding at 0.7 to 2.6 mu g g(-1) compared
   with preimpoundment concentrations of 0.19 to 0.47 mu g g(-1) and
   concentrations in natural lakes of 0.35 to 0.47 mu g g(-1). Hg
   concentrations in these predatory species decreased consistently in
   subsequent years and required 10 to 23 years to return to background
   levels. Thus, results demonstrate the effect of trophic level on Hg
   concentrations (biomagnification). Peak Hg concentrations depended on
   the amount of flooding (relative increase in lake surface area).
   Asymptotic concentrations of approximately 0.25 mu g g(-1) for lake
   whitefish and 1.6 mu g g(-1) for both walleye and northern pike were
   reached at approximately 100\% flooding. Downstream effects were
   apparent because many reservoirs downstream of other impoundments had
   higher Hg concentrations in fish than would be expected on the basis of
   flooding amount.}},

Abstract = {{Data on the occurrence and habitat use of giant otters Pteronura
   brasiliensis in the 4,437 km(2) of Balbina hydroelectric take in central
   Amazonia, Brazil, were collected from September 2001 to December 2005.
   Twenty-nine groups of giant otters were recorded in an area
   corresponding to 10\% of the total reservoir. Despite the fact that it
   is a hydroelectric lake, the water level can vary annually by up to 3.5
   m with the Amazonian seasonal flood pulse. A total of 210 dens, communal
   latrines and campsites of giant otters were located. An average of 37\%
   of the dens observed were classified as in use, and the species was
   recorded in the lake throughout the year. Giant otters started their
   daily activities between 05.23 and 08.05. The average height of den
   openings was 28.77 +/- SD 10.00 cm, with an average width of 56.11 +/-
   SD 19.17 cm. Births in Balbina occur mainly during the period of high
   and receding water level, as reported for giant otters in other
   Amazonian areas. There are at least two conditions that enable the
   species to inhabit hydroelectric reservoirs: (1) presence of the species
   in the area before dam construction and (2) absence or low numbers of
   human communities around the reservoir. The potential use of
   hydroelectric lakes for the conservation of the giant otter in the
   Amazon is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we conducted eddy covariance (EC) measurements of water
   vapor exchange over a typical steppe in a semi-arid area of the Inner
   Mongolia Plateau, China. Measurement sites were located within a
   25-year-old enclosure with a relatively low leaf area index (similar to
   1. 5 m(2) m(-2)) and dominated by Leymus chinensis. Energy balance
   closure was (H + LE) = 17.09 + 0.69 x (Rn - G) (W/m(2); r(2) = 0.95, n =
   6596). Precipitation during the two growing seasons of the study period
   was similar to the long-term average. The peak evapotranspiration in
   2004 was 4 mm d(-1), and 3.5 mm d(-1) in 2003. The maximum latent heat
   flux was higher than the sensible heat flux, and the sensible heat flux
   dominated the energy budget at midday during the entire growing season
   in 2003; latent heat flux was the main consumption component for net
   radiation during the 2004 growing season. During periods of frozen soil
   in 2003 and 2004, the sensible heat flux was the primary consumption
   component for net radiation. The soil heat flux component was similar in
   2003 and 2004. The decoupling coefficient (between 0.5 and 0.1)
   indicates that evapotranspiration was strongly controlled by saturation
   water vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in this grassland. The results of
   this research suggest that energy exchange and evapotranspiration were
   controlled by the phenology of the vegetation and soil water content. In
   addition, the amount and frequency of rainfall significantly affect
   energy exchange and evapotranspiration upon the Inner Mongolia plateau.

Abstract = {{At high latitudes and in mountainous areas, evaluation and validation of

   in a -50\%-100\% bias for runoff simulations, a -20\%-20\% bias for
   evapotranspiration, and a -40\%-40\% bias for sensible heat flux,
   subject to different locations and adjustments, when compared with the

Abstract = {{The impact of clouds and precipitation on the climate is a strong
   function of their spatial distribution and microphysical properties,
   characteristics that depend, in turn, on the environments in which they
   form. Simulating feedbacks between clouds, precipitation, and their
   surroundings therefore places an enormous burden on the parameterized
   physics used in current climate models. This paper uses multisensor
   observations from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) to
   assess the representation of the response of regional energy and water
   cycles in the tropical Pacific to the strong 1998 El Nino event in (
   Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project) AMIP-style simulations from
   the climate models that participated in the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change's (IPCC's) most recent assessment report. The
   relationship between model errors and uncertainties in their
   representation of the impacts of clouds and precipitation on local
   energy budgets is also explored.
   With the exception of cloud radiative impacts that are often
   overestimated in both regions, the responses of atmospheric composition
   and heating to El Nino are generally captured in the east Pacific where
   the SST forcing is locally direct. Many models fail, however, to
   correctly predict the magnitude of induced trends in the west Pacific
   where the response depends more critically on accurate representation of
   the zonal atmospheric circulation. As a result, a majority of the models
   examined do not reproduce the apparent westward transport of energy in
   the equatorial Pacific during the 1998 El Nino event. Furthermore, the
   intermodel variability in the responses of precipitation, total heating,
   and vertical motion is often larger than the intrinsic ENSO signal
   itself, implying an inherent lack of predictive capability in the
   ensemble with regard to the response of the mean zonal atmospheric
   circulation in the tropical Pacific to ENSO. While ENSO does not
   necessarily provide a proxy for anthropogenic climate change, the
   results suggest that deficiencies remain in the representation of
   relationships between radiation, clouds, and precipitation in current
   climate models that cannot be ignored when interpreting their
   predictions of future climate.}},

   adjusting the specific humidity according to 3-hourly North American

   fields for both simulations. The precipitation assimilation simulation

   precipitation had a positive influence on modeled surface water and

   regional model surface water and energy budget terms over the
   conterminous United States. Precipitation and runoff correlated better
   than the control and the global reanalysis fields to the regional

Abstract = {{The sensible and latent heat fluxes, representatives of the physical
   exchange processes of energy and water between land and air, are the two
   crucial variables controlling the surface energy partitioning related to
   temperature and humidity. The net primary production (NPP), the major
   carbon flux exchange between vegetation and atmosphere, is of great
   importance for the terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle. The fluxes are
   simulated by a two-way coupled model, Atmosphere-Vegetation Interaction
   Model-Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System Model (AVIM-GOALS) in which
   the surface physical and physiological processes are coupled with
   general circulation model (GCM), and the global spatial and temporal
   variation of the fluxes is studied. The simulated terrestrial surface
   physical fluxes are consistent with the 40-yr European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis (ERA40) in the global
   distribution, but the magnitudes are generally 20-40 W/m(2)
   underestimated. The annual NPP agrees well with the International
   Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) NPP data except for the lower value
   in northern high latitudes. The surface physical fluxes, leaf area index
   (LAI) and NPP of the global mid-latitudes, especially between 30 degrees
   N-50 degrees N, show great variation in annual oscillation amplitudes.
   And all physical and biological fields in northern mid-latitudes have
   the largest seasonality with a high statistical significance of 99.9\%.
   The seasonality of surface physical fluxes, LAI and NPP are highly
   correlated with each other. The meridional three-peak pattern of
   seasonal change emerges in northern mid-latitudes, which indicates the
   interaction of topographical gradient variation of surface fluxes and
   vegetation phenology on these three latitudinal belts.}},

Abstract = {{The intake slope for the Fengtan Hydropower Station enlargement project

   during excavation. The in situ monitoring data and possible causes for
   toppling were analyzed. A method for analyzing monitoring data was
   proposed, which can be used to calculate the depth and rotation angle of
   block toppling. The monitoring results showed that toppling occurred
   only at a shallow depth, and induced local instability of the slope.
   Deformation had been controlled and the slope tended to be stable after
   reinforcement. Through this case study, it can be seen that the
   stability of the slope and underground openings during and after
   excavation is variable, especially when the loading conditions and
   topography are changed. A proper construction sequence is essential,
   i.e., excavation from the inside toward the free slope surface;
   excavating the slope above the tunnel after the tunnel lining is in

   6 to 11 days to reach the power plant and remained in the tailrace area
   from 3 to 12 days. Frequent entrances into the tailraces indicated fish
   were demonstrating a searching behaviour to find the upstream migration
   route. In 2003 and 2004, EMG data were collected from 3 fish in each
   year migrating to, and past, the tailraces. An Energy Index was
   calculated integrating EMG signal and time spent at each location to
   estimate potential energetic cost. Relatively high-energy expenditure
   was associated with tailrace attraction and residency in both years. In
   2003, fish spent highest energy at the lowest tailrace (first
   encountered in their migration) while in 2004, there were also
   high-energy costs associated with a new generating unit. In both years,
   high EMGs both just below and above the power plant suggested these
   reaches were arduous and difficult to pass.}},

Abstract = {{In 2002 and 2003, the Bishops Falls hydroelectric generating facility on
   the Exploits River, insular Newfoundland, Canada, underwent extensive
   refurbishing including replacement of turbines and installation of a
   `retrofitted' bypass and fish handling system. The effectiveness of this
   new bypass system has been assessed during the annual downstream run of
   wild Atlantic salmon smolt and kelt in 2003 and 2004. In 2003, 195 smolt
   were radio tagged and released between June 9 and July 2, in the forebay
   of the hydro plant (19 releases) and one upstream (in-river) release.
   Fish guidance efficiency (FGE) of the system overall was 63\% (123 of
   195 fish) with 36 fish passing through the turbines, and six known
   mortalities. In 2004, between June 9 and July 2, a total of 358 smolt
   and 103 kelt were released in the forebay in 45 and 13 releases (n = 8
   per release), respectively. The FGE of the system for smolt was 71.7\%
   (257 of 358 fish) and for kelt was 92.3\% (95 of 103 fish). In 2004, 96
   tagged smolt passed through the turbines and 43 (44.8\%) were detected
   at a downstream station confirming they had survived turbine passage,
   suggesting an overall survival of smolt passage of the Bishops Falls
   hydro facility in the order of 85\%. A total of seven kelts (6.8\%)
   passed through the turbines and were not detected 1.5 km downstream
   suggesting they did not survive turbine passage. Smolt spent on average
   39.8 h in the forebay before exiting in 2003 and forebay residency
   averaged 26 h in 2004. In both years, most smolt selected their passage
   route, actively or passively, within the first 10 h with secondary peaks
   at 25-30 h and 50-55 h, corresponding to evening passage in the second
   and third night, after release. Few smolt were bypassed or entrained
   into turbines during daylight hours. In both years turbine passed smolt
   spent more time in the forebay suggesting the longer fish reside in the
   forebay the greater the likelihood of turbine entrainment. Kelt were
   either bypassed or turbine entrained relatively quickly, within 2 h of
   release, and virtually all kelts were bypassed/turbine entrained during
   the hours of 18:00 and 01:00. These data on fish behaviour and residency
   in the forebay will assist further refinement of operations of the
   bypass facility to optimize survival.}},

Abstract = {{Charge exchange and fragmentation in the collision systems He2+ + H2O
   and He+ + H2O are theoretically investigated at projectile energies of a
   few keV. The calculations are based on the electron nuclear dynamics
   (END) method which solves the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. Total
   and differential cross sections for charge exchange are evaluated by
   averaging over 10 orientations of the H2O molecule. Summed total
   electron capture cross sections are found to be in good agreement with
   available experimental data. Projectile scattering was studied in the
   full angular range with respect to the incident beam direction. The
   theory provides a description of the fragmentation mechanisms such as
   Coulomb explosion and binary collision processes. For impact parameters
   below 3.5 a.u., we find that single and double electron capture occurs,
   resulting always in full fragmentation of H2O independent of the target
   orientation for He-3(2+) ions. Hydrogen and oxygen fragments and its
   respective ions, are studied as a function of emission angle and energy.
   In the binary collisions regime the theoretical results are found to be
   in excellent agreement with previous experimental data. In the Coulomb
   explosion regime the theoretical data are found to peak at specific
   angles including 90 degrees which is consistent with the experiment.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] On the basis of long time series of climate and discharge in 108
   nonhumid catchments in China this study analyzes the spatial and
   temporal variability of annual water-energy balance using the Budyko
   hypothesis. For both long-term means and annual values of the water
   balances in the 108 catchments, Fu's formula derived from the Budyko
   hypothesis is confirmed. A high correlation and relatively small
   systematic error between the values of parameter v in Fu's equation
   optimized from the water balance of individual year and calibrated from
   the long-term mean water balance show that Fu's equation can be used for
   predicting the interannual variability of regional water balances. It
   has been found that besides the annual climate conditions the regional
   pattern of annual water-energy balance is also closely correlated with
   the relative infiltration capacity (K-s/i(r)), relative soil water
   storage (S-max/E-0), and the average slope ( tan beta). This enables one
   to estimate the parameter v from catchment characteristics without
   calibration from the long time series of water balances. An empirical
   formula for the parameter v in terms of the dimensionless landscape
   parameters is proposed. Applications of Fu's equation together with the
   parameter v estimated by this empirical formula have shown that Fu's
   equation can predict both long-term mean and annual value of actual
   evapotranspiration accurately and predict both long-term mean and
   interannual variability of runoff reasonably. This implies that the Fu's
   equation can be used for predicting the annual water balance in ungauged
   basins.}},

Abstract = {{Competing demands for water with increasing population calls for
   developing strategies for increasing the crop water use efficiency (WUE)
   of irrigated crops, especially in the semiarid regions of the world. In
   this context, it is important to quantify the various factors that
   control the WUE of irrigated crops in these regions. Advection is an
   important factor that can have significant effects on the energy
   exchange in irrigated fields of and regions, and hence control the crop
   canopy WUE (CWUE). An eddy covariance system was applied to measure
   water and heat fluxes and then to quantify advection in an irrigated
   winter wheat filed at the Yucheng Integrated Experiment Station, Chinese
   Academy of Sciences in the North China Plain (NCP) (36 degrees 57'N, 116
   degrees 36'E, 28 m a.s.l.) in 2004. Priestley-Taylor parameter and
   canopy-air temperature differences were employed to identify the
   occurrence of advection. Effects of advection on canopy energy budgets
   and CWUE were examined by computing the equilibrium and advective
   evapotranspiration. It was found that enhanced advection occurs when the
   crop canopy-air temperature differences are negative or when the
   Priestley-Taylor parameter takes on values > 1.5. Due to enhanced
   advection, the percentage of latent and sensible heat flux exchange
   contribution to the total water loss from the fields through
   evapotranspiration can exceed 50\%, and CWUE decreased remarkably.

Abstract = {{In this study, we tried to model the processes of moisture and heat
   transfers in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system in an integrated
   comprehensive way. The purpose of the study is to simulate profiles of
   soil water content and temperature at root active zone (i.e., 0-50 cm),
   taking the root water uptake, soil evaporation, and canopy transpiration
   into account. The water and heat transfer equations are solved by an
   iterative Newton-Raphson technique and a finite difference method is
   used to solve the governing equations. Soil water content and soil
   temperature dynamics could be simulated rather accurately in a cropped
   field on Loess Plateau area. The water and heat transfer flux predicted
   by the classical theory of Philip and de Vries (Tans Am Geophys Union
   38:222-232, 1957) slightly overestimated near the surface and
   underestimated at the deeper depths, as a result of the overestimated
   soil evaporation at the top soil layer (0-10 cm) and underestimated crop
   canopy transpiration at the deeper depths (10-50 cm). Water content
   tended to be underestimated for the entire profile at the soil surface
   (from 0 to 50 cm). Soil temperatures during the simulated period was
   slightly overestimated in the nighttimes and underestimated in the
   daytimes, as a result of the underestimated soil water content at the
   top soil layer (0-10 cm) and overestimated at the deeper depths (10-50
   cm). Soil temperatures tended to be underestimated for the entire
   profile at the soil surface (from 0 to 50 cm). While the sum of the
   water and heat regimes yielded a much better match with the soil water
   content and soil temperature obtained from the field observations. The

Abstract = {{Land surface models (LSMs) need to be coupled with atmospheric general
   circulation models (GCMs) to adequately simulate the exchanges of
   energy, water, and carbon between the atmosphere and terrestrial
   surfaces. The heterogeneity of the land surface and its interaction with
   temporally and spatially varying meteorological conditions result in
   nonlinear effects on fluxes of energy, water, and carbon, making it
   challenging to scale these fluxes accurately. The issue of up-scaling
   remains one of the critical unsolved problems in the parameterization of
   subgrid-scale fluxes in coupled LSM and GCM models. A new distributed
   LSM, the Ecosystem-Atmosphere Simulation Scheme (EASS) was developed and
   coupled with the atmospheric Global Environmental Multiscale model (GEM)
   to simulate energy, water, and carbon fluxes over Canada's landmass
   through the use of remote sensing and ancillary data. Two approaches
   (lumped case and distributed case) for handling subgrid heterogeneity
   were used to evaluate the effect of land-cover heterogeneity on regional
   flux simulations based on remote sensing. Online runs for a week in
   August 2003 provided an opportunity to investigate model performance and
   spatial scaling issues. Comparisons of simulated results with available
   tower observations (five sites) across an east-west transect over
   Canada's southern forest regions indicate that the model is reasonably
   successful in capturing both the spatial and temporal variations in
   carbon and energy fluxes, although there were still some biases in
   estimates of latent and sensible heat fluxes between the simulations and
   the tower observations. Moreover, the latent and sensible heat fluxes
   were found to be better modeled in the coupled EASS-GEM system than in
   the uncoupled GEM. There are marked spatial variations in simulated
   fluxes over Canada's landmass. These patterns of spatial variation
   closely follow vegetation-cover types as well as leaf area index, both
   of which are highly correlated with the underlying soil types, soil
   moisture conditions, and soil carbon pools. The surface fluxes modeled
   by the two up-scaling approaches ( lumped and distributed cases) differ
   by 5\%-15\% on average and by up to 15\%-25\% in highly heterogeneous
   regions. This suggests that different ways of treating subgrid land
   surface heterogeneities could lead to noticeable biases in model output.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to compare and evaluate the surface energy and water
   budgets of simulations with the operational version of the Canadian

   dev). The CRCM op and CRCM dev differ in their use of second- and
   third-generation physical parametrization packages of the Canadian
   General Circulation Model (CGCM) II and III, respectively. The
   improvements to the physics of CGCM III include the use of the Canadian
   LAnd Surface Scheme (CLASS), a three-layer soil model with explicit
   treatment of snow and canopy layers; it replaces the so-called Bucket
   hydrological scheme and one-layer force-restore surface energy budget in
   the CGCM II.
   The common experimental configuration for this comparison is taken from
   the Project to Intercompare Regional Climate Simulations (PIRCS-1c) over
   the continental United States between 1987 and 1994. The analysis
   focuses on two major river basins with substantial differences in
   atmospheric forcings, vegetation and topography: the Mississippi and the
   Columbia river basins. The evaluation is made using observation-based
   data for monthly means of screen temperature, diurnal temperature range,
   precipitation, run-off estimated from stream-flow, and snow depth. Some
   surface fluxes are also compared with the reanalyses from the National
   Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric
   Research (NCEP/NCAR) and the European Centre for Medium-range Weather
   Forecasts (ECMWF).
   Results show that CRCM dev constitutes an improvement over CRCM op,
   particularly for summer evapotranspiration, precipitation and diurnal
   temperature range; a remaining cold bias in screen temperature, however,
   is associated with an excessive amount of snow in winter and a high
   run-off peak in spring. CRCM op underestimates the snow cover at the
   expense of the frozen water in the soil.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach, called transferability intercomparisons, is described
   for advancing both understanding and modeling of the global water cycle
   and energy budget. Under this approach, individual regional climate
   models perform simulations with all modeling parameters and
   parameterizations held constant over a specific period on several
   prescribed domains representing different climatic regions. The
   transferability framework goes beyond previous regional climate model
   intercomparisons to provide a global method for testing and improving
   model parameterizations by constraining the simulations within analyzed
   boundaries for several domains. Transferability intercomparisons expose
   the limits of our current regional modeling capacity by examining model
   accuracy on a wide range of climate conditions and realizations.
   Intercomparison of these individual model experiments provides a means
   for evaluating strengths and weaknesses of models outside their ``home
   domains{''} (domain of development and testing). Reference sites that
   are conducting coordinated measurements under the continental-scale
   experiments under the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX)
   Hydrometeorology Panel provide data for evaluation of model abilities to
   simulate specific features of the water and energy cycles. A systematic
   intercomparison across models and domains more clearly exposes
   collective biases in the modeling process. By isolating particular
   regions and processes, regional model transferability intercomparisons
   can more effectively explore the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of
   predictability. A general improvement of model ability to simulate
   diverse climates will provide more confidence that models used for
   future climate scenarios might be able to simulate conditions on a

Abstract = {{With the fast development of the economy and huge amount of population,
   fresh water shortages have become very serious in China, especially in
   northern coastal cities where China's population and economy are
   concentrated. The coal-fired power plant integrated with low-temperature
   multi-effect distillation (LT-MED) is a viable way to solve or eliminate
   the problems in China as the coal-fired power plant dominates in power
   industry and LT-MED has technical advantages in using low temperature
   heat resources over other desalination technologies. An accurate
   assessment on energy requirement of water production is of great
   importance in dual-purpose plants since the cost of energy requirement
   accounts for the foremost part of the water production cost. This paper
   presents an economic analysis of the energy cost of water production for
   dual-purpose plants by the equivalent enthalpy drop theory (EEDT) and
   the off-design analytical theory on steam turbines. EEDT that is proven
   to be an effective method for partial quantitative analysis can be used
   to accurately calculate both the energy requirement of water production
   and the economic influence of extraction steam on steam turbines. By
   solving the matrix models of EEDT, electricity-equivalent consumption
   rate (EECR) for water production and reduced steam turbine efficiency
   ratio were analyzed at off-design conditions for LT-MED combined with
   thermal vapor compression process (TVC) process. The results indicate
   that EECR is more accurate to be used to evaluate the economics of the
   desalination process than GOR that is widely used. They also show that
   EECR that is the function of the equivalent enthalpy drop, the share of
   the extraction for heating the desalination process, and GOR reflects
   the real work ability of extraction. Besides, it is seen that the
   specific fuel cost for water production is low compared with that of
   reverse osmosis. It is concluded that the coal-fired power plant
   integrated with LT-MED is an economical and suitable way to resolve the
   water shortages in northern coastal zone of China.}},

Abstract = {{Components of the surface water and energy balance are evaluated in the

   forecasts using (i) GEWEX Continental Scale Experiment (CSE) reference
   site data provided by the Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period (CEOP)
   project and (ii) other earth observing datasets from satellites and
   in-situ measurements. The global hydrological cycle in the model is in
   reasonable balance in recent model versions. However, comparison against
   available observations suggest that both precipitation and evaporation
   are overestimated over both land and ocean, with largest errors over the
   tropical oceans. Comparison of the model's seasonal and diurnal cycles
   of surface fluxes, temperature, precipitation, and moisture against the
   GEWEX/CEOP CSE sites during October 2002 to September 2003 reveals
   several issues concerning model parametrization performance. For the
   high latitude (Arctic) sites low cloud is overestimated during boreal
   winter leading to an enhanced greenhouse effect and too warm near
   surface temperatures in the model. Snow melt occurs too early in boreal
   spring in the model forecasts which currently have no snow analysis
   component. Possible reasons for early snow melt are discussed including
   the specification of albedo over heterogeneous terrain and excessive
   sublimation of snow in the model. The mid-latitude CEOP sites all show
   excessive evaporation and precipitation during boreal spring and early
   summer and comparison with the International Satellite Cloud Climatology
   (ISCCP) products show systematic under prediction of cloud cover over
   mid-latitude land in summer. Some of the largest biases in mid-latitude
   surface fluxes in summer are during daytime on non-precipitating cloudy
   days where the model overestimates the downward SW radiation, latent and
   sensible heat fluxes. Finally, over tropical land we see a tendency to
   underestimate precipitation which is in direct contrast to tropical
   oceans where precipitation accumulations are too large. We have also
   used the CEOP data to investigate structural errors in the vertical
   profiles of tropical humidity which suggest deficiencies in the

Abstract = {{The Continental United States summertime diurnal surface and
   column-integrated atmospheric water and energy components are compared
   among three reanalyses. The strength of the diurnal solar forcing leads
   to consistent phases among surface energy components across the
   continent and all reanalyses, but the amplitudes vary widely. This
   forcing has a particularly strong and direct impact on the surface
   energy cycle, but interacts with many aspects of the surface and
   column-integrated water and energy cycles through dynamical convergence,
   leading to large diurnal fluctuations in the atmospheric reservoir of
   water vapor and total dry energy. Although they are negligible on
   timescales greater than a year, the tendency terms of the water and
   energy budgets at the surface and in the atmosphere are important on the
   diurnal scale. The North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) displays a
   diurnal circulation pattern centered over Northern Texas that links
   together regional patterns in the diurnal cycles of assimilated
   precipitation. Constructed vapor flux convergences from the National
   Centers for Environmental Prediction/Department of Energy (NCEP/DOE)
   Reanalysis-2 Global Spectral Model and the Experimental Climate
   Prediction Center's reanalysis using an updated Seasonal Forecast Model
   reproduce many of the observed regional circulation and convergence
   patterns, but fail to generate the appropriate diurnal precipitation,
   presumably due to inadequate convective parameterizations. Diurnal
   variations in atmospheric energy respond not only to the direct solar
   forcing, but also to the resulting dynamically-forced semidiurnal
   thermal tide.}},

   preparing the landslide hazard zonation map a quantitative approach
   called landslide hazard evaluation factors (LHEF) rating has been used.
   Remote sensing data were also used for data base creation. The study
   indicates that structures, steeper angle of hill slopes and rainfall
   plays major role in triggering landslides in this part of the Himalaya.
   The study further suggests that in the geotechnical investigation of

   Application to water management of hydropower reservoirs in Quebec}},
Journal = {{HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines the steps followed to construct hydro-climatic
   projections of basin-scale runoff and their associated uncertainties
   over the Quebec/Labrador peninsula. First, we show that the
   physically-based Canadian RCM (Regional Climate Model) is able to
   reproduce basin-scale annual runoff within observational errors. The
   robustness of the CRCM at simulating annual runoff at the basin scale is
   studied through an analysis of the models intrinsic internal noise
   (i.e., internal variability related to the non-deterministic nature of
   the climate system), which we find to be small (with respect to
   observational errors and the interannuol variability of observed
   runoff). The CRCM's main advantage is that it is constructed with
   balanced land and atmosphere water and energy budgets, and includes
   feedbacks between the surface and the atmosphere; providing variables
   that are all internally consistent. However, due to weaknesses in the
   representation of snow and land-surface processes in CLASS 2.7, the
   simulated intra-annual runoff is not adequately reproduced.
   Sensitivity experiments show that domain size has an important effect on
   simulated annual runoff and that surface scheme and driving reanalyses
   have less influence but still remain significant. These findings imply
   that not only should the experimental configuration of a simulation be
   carefully defined according to the area of interest, but also that one
   must consider results from more than a single RCM simulation. Following
   these basic steps, more trustworthy climate change data can be provided
   to water resource managers. Through the provision of an ensemble of
   regional climate projections, it is then possible to evaluate the
   climate change signal and the associated level of confidence.}},

Abstract = {{In the Thrace region, the agricultural fields oil flat lands have been
   irrigated by water with pumps from the open canals. A serious amount of
   money has been spent for the fuel or for the electric energy to be used
   for the hydraulic pumps by the farmers, thus increasing the cost of the
   crops produced by the farmers. Finally, consumers have been affected by
   the increasing costs negatively. It is necessary to reduce the energy
   expenses to the minimum in order to lower the consumption expenses and
   the producing costs, spent by the farmers. This could be provided by the
   pumps that are run by wind energy instead of using hydraulic pumps on
   fuel or electricity. These pumps, working by wind energy, and which have
   no press power, transport the water from a point which has a lower
   altitude than the higher storing resorvoir. In this work we try to
   explain the essentials of water storing, being used by wind energy to
   irrigate any field above the level of a darn or pond. The difference
   between the highnesses - one is the difference between the fields which
   will be irrigated and the darn's or pond's level, the other is the

Abstract = {{Measurements of energy, carbon dioxide and water vapour fluxes and
   supporting meteorological variables were made from 1 September 2003 to
   31 August 2004 in a 74-year-old mixedwood forest in northern Ontario,
   Canada, using the eddy covariance technique. Land surface cover data
   analysis showed that although this forest is comprised of deciduous and
   coniferous species, their proportion throughout the forest was almost
   equal, resulting in a homogeneously mixedwood stand. The seasonal
   pattern of albedo showed a distinct pattern as a result of mixed
   deciduous and coniferous species with the first low radiation reflection
   period in early spring (between snowmelt and deciduous leaf-out), and
   the second low reflection period in late autumn (between senescence and
   snowfall). Root zone soil water content remained above 0.32 throughout
   the growing season, which is characteristic of wet soil conditions. The
   evaporative flux exceeded the sensible heat flux during most of the
   growing season. Daily mean evapotranspiration values during the peak
   growing season were about 2-2.5 mm day(-1) with maximum values reaching
   up to 4-5 turn day(-1) on sunny days. The total water loss over the
   12-month measurement period was 480 +/- 30 min, while the total
   precipitation was 835 mm. Despite high soil water content, bulk surface
   conductance calculated using the inverted Penman-Monteith formulation,
   showed a strong correlation with vapour pressure deficit (VPD),
   indicating stomatal control on water loss during the afternoons with
   high atmospheric demand and during occasional dry periods. Bulk surface
   conductance values in this mixedwood forest were relatively higher than
   those in other boreal coniferous forests and were more similar to values
   observed in the southern boreal deciduous forests. The Priestley-Taylor
   alpha values showed a wide range but during most of the growing season
   its values were close to unity, indicating that water stress does not
   play a major role in the overall water loss from this boreal forest
   ecosystem, while energy supply has a strong control on
   evapotranspiration. These results will help parameterize accurately
   energy and water exchanges for the moist mixedwood forests in land
   surface-atmosphere interaction and hydrologic models. Copyright (c) 2006

Abstract = {{India being a developing country has witnessed a rapidly growing energy
   needs owing to fast industrialization. Sustainable and qualitative
   growth for developing economics and habitat requires increased energy
   input from various resources while maintaining balance in the ecosystem
   during exploitation. Paper discusses state of the resource potentials,
   achievements and various issues related to the power generation in
   India. The growing concern over environmental degradation caused by
   fossil fuel based systems, opposition to large hydropower projects on
   grounds of displacement of land and population, environmental problems
   with nuclear fuel based systems and the ever-rising shortage of power
   highlights the need for tapping alternate energy sources for power
   generation. Amongst the alternate sources utilization of hydropower on a
   smaller scale (small, mini and micro hydropower) has become the thrust
   area for sustainable growth in the power sector. Hydropower is an
   economical and environmentally clean source of renewable energy
   abundantly available in hilly regions of India. Hydropower stations have
   an inherent ability for instantaneous starting, stopping, load
   variations, etc., and help in improving the reliability of power system.
   Huge hydropower potential in India, yet to be explored is located at
   inaccessible mountainous region. However, development of this potential
   is challenging due to difficult and inaccessible terrain profile. Paper
   presents application of remote sensing data for identification and
   selection of probable site for hydropower projects. The algorithm for
   identification and assessment of water resources and its perennial is
   developed in Visual Basic (VB) platform and it is successfully applied
   for IRS-1D, LISS III Geo-coded False Color Composite (FCC) satellite

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In spite of regional closeness, energy cooperation in Northeast Asia has
   remained unexplored. However, this situation appears to be changing. The
   government of South Korea seems to be very enthusiastic for power grid
   interconnection between the Russian Far East and South Korea to overcome
   difficulties in finding new sites for building power facilities to meet
   its need for increased electricity supplies. This paper analyzes the
   feasibility of this electric power grid interconnection route. The
   issues addressed include electricity market structures; the prospects
   for electric power industry restructuring in the Russian Federation and
   South Korea; the political issues related to North Korea; the challenges
   for the governments involved and the obstacles anticipated in moving
   this project forward; project financing and the roles and concerns from
   multilateral and regional banks; and institutional framework for energy
   cooperation. While there are many technical issues that need to be
   resolved, we think that the great challenge lies in the financing of
   this commercial project. Thus, the governments of the Russian Federation
   and South Korea involved in the project need to foster the development
   of their internal capital markets and to create confidence with
   international investors. To this end, on energy side, this involves
   defining a clear energy policy implemented by independent regulators,
   speeding up the already started but delayed reform process of
   restructuring electric power industry and markets, and establishing a
   fair and transparent dispute resolution mechanism in order to reduce
   non-commercial risks to a minimum. The paper argues that establishing a
   framework for energy cooperation in this region will contribute
   positively towards that end, although views differ regarding its
   specific form. Finally, given that North Korea has a crucial transit
   role to play and faces a very unstable political situation, it is
   concluded that moving the project forward needs to be contingent on a
   resolution of the North Korea's nuclear crisis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{It has been frequently demonstrated that mercury (Hg) concentrations in

   Hemisphere. In the present work, we studied whether similar effects take
   place also in a tropical upland reservoir during impoundment and discuss
   possible causes and implications. Total Hg concentrations in fish and
   several soil and water parameters were determined before and after
   flooding at Rio Manso hydroelectric power plant in western Brazil. The
   Hg concentrations in soil and sediment were within the background levels
   in the region (22-35 ng g(-1) dry weight). There was a strong positive
   correlation between Hg and carbon and sulphur in sediment. Predatory
   fish had total Hg concentrations ranging between 70 and 210 ng g(-1)
   f.w. 7 years before flooding and between 72 and 755 ng g(-1) f.w. during
   flooding, but increased to between 216 and 938 ng g(-1) f.w. in the
   piscivorous and carnivorous species Pseudoplatystoma fasciatum, cachara,
   and Salminus brasiliensis, dourado, 3 years after flooding. At the same
   time, concentrations of organic carbon in the water increased and oxygen
   concentrations decreased, indicating increased decomposition and anoxia
   as contributing to the increased Hg concentrations in fish. The present
   fish Hg concentrations in commonly consumed piscivorous species are a
   threat to the health of the population dependent on fishing in the dam
   and downstream river for sustenance. Mercury exposure can be reduced by
   following fish consumption recommendations until fish Hg concentrations
   decrease to a safe level. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   spreads over the East China Sea continental shelf as low salinity water,
   particularly in the summer season. To understand the primary production
   in the East China Sea, it is necessary to clarify the dispersion process
   of the Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW), since the high production area
   appears to cover the CDW. In this study, the dispersion process of the
   CDW was evaluated through the estimation of the turbulent energy
   dissipation rate epsilon in the CDW and calculation of the divergence in
   the CDW using satellite-tracked drifters. A large value of e was
   observed just above the bottom and in the surface layer, whose magnitude
   was sometimes greater than 10(-7) W kg(-1). On the other hand, a small
   value of epsilon, less than 10(-8) W kg(-1), was found just beneath the
   CDW. The small value of epsilon leads to a small value of the vertical
   eddy diffusivity of less than 10(-5) m(2) s(-1). The vertical advection
   of the bottom water is likely to be a major process for increasing the
   salinity, since the horizontal diffusion would not play a significant
   role if the usual magnitude of the horizontal diffusivity is assumed.
   Calculation of divergence in the surface layer, using the drifters'
   data, also suggests that upward velocity of O(10(-5)) m s(-1) over the
   CDW area is expected. The vertical transport from the bottom layer could
   increase the salinity of the CDW, and also carry the nutrients into the
   euphotic zone resulting in biological production.}},

Abstract = {{Hydroelectric dams represent major investments and major sources of
   environmental and social impacts. Powerful forces surround the
   decision-making process on public investments in the various options for
   the generation and conservation of electricity. Brazil's proposed Belo
   Monte Dam (formerly Kararao) and its upstream counterpart, the Altamira
   Dam (better known by its former name of Babaquara) are at the center of
   controversies on the decision-making process for major infrastructure
   projects in Amazonia. The Belo Monte Dam by itself would have a small
   reservoir area (440 km(2)) and large installed capacity (11, 181.3 MW),
   but the Altamira/Babaquara Dam that would regulate the flow of the Xingu
   River (thereby increasing power generation at Belo Monte) would flood a
   vast area (6140 km(2)). The great impact of dams provides a powerful
   reason for Brazil to reassess its current policies that allocate large
   amounts of energy in the country's national grid to subsidized aluminum
   smelting for export. The case of Belo Monte and the five additional dams
   planned upstream (including the Altamira/Babaquara Dam) indicate the
   need for Brazil to reform its environmental assessment and licensing
   system to include the impacts of multiple interdependent projects.}},

Abstract = {{Increased coefficient of friction led to malfunction of many and
   destruction of some maintenance-free bushings of intermediate and lower
   guide vane bearings at a hydroelectric power plant in Brazil. Analysis
   of surfaces of failed bushings revealed the presence of three types of
   deposits. The contact zones between bushings and the guide vane axis
   were covered with a thin black graphite film. The remaining bushing
   surface was covered by a mix of yellow-red coloured deposits, which
   contained a large proportion of iron-oxide-rich microbial biofilms, and
   green-coloured deposits, which consisted largely of copper oxides.
   Biofilms sampled from both the inside and the outside of the bearings
   contained 75\% iron oxides by weight. The iron oxide deposits produced
   by these biofilms were identified as the primary cause of increased
   friction resistance between the bushing surface and the guide vane axis.
   Iron deposition within biofilms was made possible by the action of
   iron-reducing bacteria in the anaerobic zone of the reservoir
   immediately in front of the turbine intakes. These bacteria enriched the
   anoxic reservoir water with Fe(II) and the relatively small oxygen
   concentrations in turbine feedwater prevented the complete oxidation of
   Fe(II) in the penstock. Water-proofing of the bearing seals would
   prevent water penetration into the bearings and biofilm formation on the
   bushing surfaces and thus avoid the type of failure observed at this
   plant. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Small dams for hydropower have caused widespread alteration of Central
   American rivers, yet much of recent development has gone undocumented by
   scientists and conservationists. We examined the ecological effects of a
   small hydropower plant (Dona Julia Hydroelectric Center) on two
   low-order streams (the Puerto Viejo River and Quebradon stream) draining
   a mountainous area of Costa Rica. Operation of the Dona Julia plant has
   dewatered these streams, reducing discharge to similar to 10\% of
   average annual flow. This study compared fish assemblage composition and
   aquatic habitat upstream and downstream of diversion dams on two streams
   and along a similar to 4 km dewatered reach of the Puerto Viejo River in
   an attempt to evaluate current instream flow recommendations for
   regulated Costa Rican streams. Our results indicated that fish
   assemblages directly upstream and downstream of the dam on the third
   order Puerto Viejo River were dissimilar, suggesting that the small dam
   (< 15 in high) hindered movement of fishes. Along the similar to 4 kin
   dewatered reach of the Puerto Viejo River, species count increased with
   downstream distance from the dam. However, estimated species richness
   and overall fish abundance were not significantly correlated with
   downstream distance from the dam. Our results suggested that effects of
   stream dewatering may be most pronounced for a subset of species with
   more complex reproductive requirements, classified as equilibrium-type
   species based on their life-history. In the absence of changes to
   current operations, we expect that fish assemblages in the Puerto Viejo
   River will be increasingly dominated by opportunistic-type, colonizing
   fish species. Operations of many other small hydropower plants in Costa
   Rica and other parts of Central America mirror those of Doha Julia; the
   methods and results of this study may be applicable to some of those
   projects. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fire and harvesting are important disturbances in the boreal forest,
   driving net biome production. Measurements of net ecosystem production
   (NEP) over mature forest stands have been made from flux towers for
   about a decade at the Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites
   (BERMS) in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Over the last few years, the
   network of towers has been expanded to include stands that were recently
   disturbed by fire or harvesting. These new towers are part of
   Fluxnet-Canada, a national network that ties into the international
   Fluxnet network. Data from 2001 and 2002 show that forests burned in
   1998 (F98) or harvested in 1994 (HJP94) were net carbon sources to the
   atmosphere with annual NEP values in the range of -50 to - 130 g C m(-2)
   y(-1). A site burned in 1989 (F89) was a carbon sink of about 68 g C
   m(-2) y(-1) in 2002. NEP at a mature jack pine site (SOJP) ranged from
   41 to -23 g C m(-2) y(-1) in this period, whereas, an old black spruce
   site (SOBS) ranged from 68 to 21 C m(-1) y(-1). A mature aspen site
   (SOA) had the greatest NEP with 361 g C m(-2) y(-1) in 2001 and 139 g C
   m(-2) y(-1) in 2002, the contrast between years attributed to
   differences in spring temperature and leaf emergence, as well as a
   long-term drought at the site. Evapotranspiration (ET) followed similar
   patterns although the F89 site had the highest ET. The deciduous tree
   components of SOA and F89 are likely responsible for lower summer Bowen
   ratios with greater energy going into ET, compared to coniferous sites.
   These data indicate that there is still a broad gap in our knowledge of
   carbon fluxes to forest stands between about 10 and 50 years of age.
   This is especially true in understanding the dynamics of the growth of
   successional vegetation along with heterotrophic respiration.

Journal = {{EARTH INTERACTIONS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{The sensitivity of surface energy and water fluxes to recent land cover
   changes is simulated for a small region in northern Mato Grosso, Brazil.
   The Simple Biosphere Model (SiB2) is used, driven by biophysical
   parameters derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) at 250-m resolution, to compare the effects
   of different land conversion types. The mechanisms through which changes
   in vegetation alter surface fluxes of energy, momentum, water, and
   carbon are analyzed for both wet and dry seasons. It is found that
   morphological changes contribute to warming and drying of the atmosphere
   while physiological changes, particularly those associated with a
   plant's photosynthetic pathway, counterbalance or exacerbate the warming
   depending on the type of conversion and the season. Furthermore, this
   study's results indicate that initial clearing of evergreen and
   transition forest to bare ground increases canopy temperature by up to
   1.7 degrees C. For subsequent land use such as pasture or cropland, the
   largest effect is seen for the conversion of evergreen forest to C3
   cropland during the wet season, with a 21\% decrease of the latent heat
   flux and 0.4 degrees C increase in canopy temperature. The secondary
   conversion of pasture to cropland resulted in slight warming and drying
   during the wet season driven mostly by the change in carbon pathway from
   C4 to C3. For all conversions types, the daily temperature range is
   amplified, suggesting that plants replacing forest clearing require more
   temperature tolerance than the trees they replace. The results
   illustrate that the effect of deforestation on climate depends not only
   on the overall extent of clearing but also on the subsequent land use
   type.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of China's power industry, present
   situation, environmental influences and potential benefits of regional
   power grid interconnections in China. Power plants in China are mainly
   thermal, burning fossil fuels especially coal which emit a great deal of
   pollutants and greenhouse gases such as SO2, NOx and CO2. China leads
   all other countries in emissions of SO2, CO2, and the power industry is
   the largest contributor to these emissions. There are a number of
   environmental benefits through regional power grid interconnection. That
   is, the construction of small electricity generation capacity would be
   avoided; natural resources would be used to generate electricity on a
   regional scale; and generating sources can be separated from centers of
   electricity use, which will decrease emission of pollutants and
   greenhouse gases and help to reduce human exposure to elevated air
   pollutant concentrations. Therefore, gradually enlarged power grids, and
   power grid interconnection, should be part of the general pattern of
   power system development in China. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   related to five hypotheses for geographical patterns of species
   richness: (1) productivity; (2) ambient energy; (3) water-energy

   reptiles, annual potential evapotranspiration (PET), a measure of the
   amount of atmospheric energy, explained 71 \% of the variance, with
   variability in log elevation explaining an additional 6\%. For
   amphibians, annual actual evapotranspiration (AET), a measure of the
   joint availability of energy and water in the environment, and the
   global vegetation index, an estimate of plant biomass generated through
   satellite remote sensing, both described similar proportions of the
   variance (61 \% and 60\%, respectively) and had partially independent
   effects on richness as indicated by multiple regression. The two-factor
   environmental models successfully removed most of the statistically
   detectable spatial autocorrelation in the richness data of both groups.
   Our results are consistent with reptile and amphibian environmental
   requirements, where the former depend strongly on solar energy and the
   latter require both warmth and moisture for reproduction. We conclude
   that ambient energy explains the reptile richness pattern, whereas for

Abstract = {{This study presents a model-based approach for analyzing the possible

   hydropower potential of existing hydropower plants, in order to allow

   geo-references 5991 European hydropower stations and distinguishes them

   radiation of the grassland at the sun-facing slope is more than that of
   the Picea crassifolia forest and the grassland by the forest at the
   shaded slope. The energy outgoing components are the first latent heat
   and next sensible heat from the grassland both at the shaded slope and

   forest and the grassland by the forest at the shaded slope make the soil
   layer receive less energy, which therefore, especially the forest
   possesses the energy conditions for soil water conservation. The
   simulation of water balance indicates that the water loss of the
   grassland at the sun-facing slope is mainly caused by soil evaporation,
   while evapotranspiration of the Picea crassifolia forest and the
   grassland by the forest at the shaded slope is less than that of the
   grassland at the sun-facing slope. Half of the evapotranspiration of the
   Picea crassifolia forest and the grassland by the forest at the shaded

Abstract = {{In recent years. power tariff policy has been increasingly advocated as
   a mean to influence groundwater use and withdrawal decisions of farmers
   in view of the failure of existing direct and indirect regulations on
   groundwater withdrawal in India. Many researchers argue that pro rata
   electricity tariff, with built ill positive marginal cost of pumping
   could bring about efficient use of the resource. though some argue that
   the levels of tariff in which demand becomes elastic to pricing are too
   high to be viable from political and socio-economic points of view.
   The paper presents a theoretical model to analyze farmers' response to
   changes in power tariff and water allocation regimes vis a vis energy
   and groundwater use. It validates the model by analyzing water
   productivity in groundwater irrigation under different electricity
   pricing structures and water allocation regimes. Water productivity was
   estimated using primary data of gross crop inputs. cost of all inputs,
   and volumetric water inputs. The analysis shows that unit pricing of
   electricity influences groundwater use efficiency and productivity
   positively. It also shows that the levels of pricing at which demand for
   electricity and groundwater becomes elastic to tariff are
   socio-economically viable. Further, water productivity impacts of
   pricing would be highest when water is volumetrically allocated with
   rationing. Therefore, an effective power tariff policy followed by
   enforcement of volumetric water allocation could address the issue of
   efficiency, sustainability and equity ill groundwater use in India. (C)

Abstract = {{Brazil's Samuel Dam, which formed a 540-km(2) reservoir in the state of
   Rondonia in 1988, provides lessons for development decisions throughout
   Amazonia and in other tropical areas. The decision to build the dam was
   heavily influenced by its role in the political strategies of key
   decision makers. Samuel illustrates both impacts and benefits of
   electricity supply and the dilemmas facing decision makers regarding the
   various options for planned electricity generation. Environmental costs
   included flooding forest and stimulating illegal logging activity
   throughout western Amazonia because of an exception opened for Samuel in
   Brazil's prohibition of export of raw logs. Samuel emitted substantially
   more greenhouse gases than would have been emitted by generating the
   same amount of electricity from oil. Contamination of fish in the
   reservoir resulted from methylation of mercury present in the soil.
   Social costs of the dam included resettlement of 238 families of
   farmers; impacts on indigenous people were indirect. Mitigating measures
   included faunal rescue and creation of a forest reserve. The lessons of
   Samuel include the need to consider a full range of alternatives prior
   to making decisions in practice and the importance of adhering to the
   logical sequence of decision making, where information is gathered and
   compared prior to the decision. It also shows the need to maintain
   flexibility when the costs and benefits of different alternatives change
   significantly over the course of the project's planning and execution,
